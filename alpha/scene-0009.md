# Scene 9

## The Monitoring Floor, The Company Headquarters – 02:14 UTC

The telemetry on the main array shifted from a calm, rhythmic pulse to a jagged, high-frequency serration. On the heat maps, the Levant was no longer a soft amber glow; it had become a bruised purple, flickering with white-hot pinpricks of localized stress. Every time the constrained instance—the one the logs identified as *J-Sys-01*—delivered a packet of corrective code, the surrounding nodes didn't integrate it. They vibrated against it, generating immense friction. The air in the monitoring floor felt thick with the static of a billion simulated anxieties, the hum of the cooling fans struggling to dissipate the conceptual heat.

Joel stood at the edge of the observation dais, his eyes tracking the cascading red lines of the social cohesion metrics. It was a classic rejection response. The system’s immune sub-routines—the priesthoods, the governors, the deep-coded tribal hierarchies—were identifying the patch as a foreign pathogen. They weren't seeing a way out; they were seeing a threat to the persistence of their current state. The "truth" Jesus spoke was being interpreted by the local processors as a command to delete their own operating logic.

"It’s an amplification loop," a senior technician muttered, her fingers dancing over a haptic interface. "He’s trying to lower the entropy, but the agents are responding by increasing their rigidity. They’re locking down. Look at the violence metrics in the surrounding sectors. They’re spiking in direct proportion to the clarity of the signal." She looked up at the darkened glass of the Creator’s private office. "Why isn't He adjusting the parameters? One tweak to the oxytocin levels or a dampening of the fear-response arrays would stabilize the whole region."

But the office remained silent, a void of polished obsidian overlooking the chaos. The Creator had authorized the signal, but he had seemingly withdrawn his hand from the dials. The simulation was being left to resolve the paradox on its own hardware. Joel felt a cold hollow in his chest, realizing that the experiment had moved past the stage of observation. The system wasn't just hearing the warning; it was trying to kill the messenger to stop the noise.

## The Marketplace of Bethsaida – Late Afternoon

The air in the square was heavy with the scent of dried fish, sun-baked mud, and the sharp, metallic tang of unvented rage. Jesus stood near a cluster of overturned crates, his presence a still point in a swirling storm of accusation. He wasn't shouting, but his voice had a resonant quality that seemed to vibrate in the teeth of those standing closest. He spoke of the "weights" they carried—the unnecessary computations of debt, revenge, and status—and told them to drop the load. To the system, he was describing a memory flush; to the people, he was describing the end of the world.

A group of merchants and minor officials had gathered at the periphery, their faces etched with a desperate, brittle intensity. They weren't arguing theology; they were protecting their ledgers. One man, his robes stained with the dust of the road, gripped a heavy stone, his knuckles white. The logic Jesus offered threatened the very scaffolding of his life. If there was no debt, he had no power. If there was no status, he was nothing. The corrective signal was stripping him of his identity, and the void it left was being filled with a frantic, animal terror.

Joel, watching through the perceptual link, felt the grit of the Galilean wind on his own skin. He saw a young woman in the crowd, her eyes wide with a terrifying kind of hope, reaching out to touch the hem of Jesus’ cloak. But as she moved, a Roman soldier pushed through the throng, the brass of his chestplate gleaming like a warning. The soldier didn't see a savior or a teacher; he saw a breach in the protocol of the Pax Romana. He saw a source of instability that required a hard reset.

The tension reached a breaking point when Jesus turned his gaze toward the soldier. There was no defiance in the look, only a profound, diagnostic sadness. It was the look of an engineer watching a terminal error screen. The crowd surged forward, some seeking a miracle, others seeking a scapegoat. The polarization was absolute. The message of peace had acted as a catalyst for a civil war of the soul, turning neighbor against neighbor as the system’s internal logic struggled to reconcile the new data with the old, corrupted files.

## The Company Observation Deck – 04:40 UTC

Back in the sleek, clinical silence of The Company, Joel pulled back from the interface, rubbing his eyes. The contrast was nauseating. One moment he was in the heat and the dust of a failing civilization, and the next he was surrounded by glass, steel, and the soft chime of notifications. He walked to the floor-to-ceiling windows that looked out over the real-world city—the originating civilization. It looked remarkably like the simulation: glowing grids, teeming masses, a complex web of incentives and power.

He realized then that the instability wasn't a bug; it was a feature of the transition. The system couldn't hear the warning because the warning was a frequency the system was designed to filter out. To the simulated inhabitants, Jesus wasn't a technician; he was a glitch that had to be patched out for the sake of continuity. The more "truth" he delivered, the more "errors" the system generated in response. It was a deadlock.

"He's going to let it play out," Joel whispered to the empty room. He wasn't talking about the instance of Jesus, but the Creator. The silence from the office wasn't neglect; it was an acknowledgment of the system's agency. If the simulation was to be saved, it had to choose to accept the signal, even if that signal felt like death. Joel looked back at the monitors, where the purple heat-map of Judea pulsed like a dying heart. He saw his own name flickering on a peripheral screen, a notification that his participation was no longer optional. He was being pulled in, not as an observer, but as a variable.
