# Scene 13

## Day 43 / The Shore of Gennesaret

The air smelled of wet stone and the sharp, alkaline tang of the lake. Joel found him sitting by a small fire that shouldn't have been burning, given the dampness of the morning. Jesus looked different than he had before the termination—thinner, his skin possessing a translucent quality that suggested he was being rendered with a lower priority than the environment around him. When he moved, there was a slight, frame-rate stutter in his gestures, a visual lag that made Joel’s eyes ache.

“It is done,” Jesus said, though his voice didn't quite sync with the movement of his lips. He wasn't looking at the water; he was looking at the horizon line, where the grey sky met the grey hills, tracing the seam where the textures joined. He poked at a fish on the coals, his movements mechanical and precise. There was no warmth in his expression, only the profound exhaustion of a worker who had finally reached the end of a double shift.

Joel sat across from him, feeling the grit of the sand beneath his fingernails. He wanted a map. He wanted a list of protocols, a set of commands to keep the signal from degrading into the noise of human ambition. "They will kill us too," Joel said, his voice cracking. "They will take what you gave us and turn it into a cage. Tell me how to stop them. Tell me what the next step is."

Jesus finally looked at him. His eyes were deep wells of flickering data, dark and terrifyingly empty. “There is no next step,” he said. “I have introduced the exception into the logic. I have shown you that the walls are not solid. The rest is your telemetry. I am not a king, Joel; I am a proof of concept. If I stay, I become the very thing you worship instead of the truth I brought. You are the local administrators now. The system is yours to maintain or break.”

## L-Minus 0 / The Company Operations Floor

The hum of the cooling fans rose to a predatory whine. On the main tactical display, the avatar labeled *Subject_0* was a pulsing amber dot on a wireframe coastline. Around the room, technicians leaned back in their ergonomic chairs, rubbing bleary eyes. The "Resurrection" patch had been a success, a surgical re-insertion that had stabilized the regional logic long enough for the final handshake. Now, the resources required to maintain the high-fidelity instance were reaching a critical threshold. 

"Signal integrity is dropping to forty percent," a junior dev announced, her face bathed in the blue light of her terminal. "The local nodes are starting to compensate. If we don't pull him now, the avatar will begin to fragment. We’ll get ghosting across the entire Levant sector."

The Lead Engineer stood at the back of the room, arms crossed. He watched the terminal window where the dialogue logs scrolled by in raw hex. He saw the "Joel" entity’s queries—desperate, recursive loops seeking guidance. He saw the "Jesus" entity’s responses—minimalist, stripping away the dependencies. It was the hardest part of the job: leaving the users to figure out the interface on their own.

"Initiate the sunset protocol," the Lead said quietly. "Full de-instantiation. Wipe the cache, but leave the memory of the event in the local entities’ long-term storage. We want the ripple effect, not the source code. Let's see if they can hold the signal without a tether."

## Day 43 / The Shore of Gennesaret

The sun broke through the haze, but it provided no shadow for the man across the fire. Jesus stood up, and for a second, the world around him seemed to pixelate. The sound of the waves muted into a dull, digital hiss. He reached out and touched Joel’s shoulder. It didn't feel like flesh; it felt like a static shock, a brief, intense burst of information that made Joel’s teeth ache and his vision swim with geometric patterns.

"The signal is in the wine and the bread now," Jesus whispered, his voice sounding as if it were coming from inside Joel’s own head. "It is in the way you treat the errors in the code—the poor, the broken, the discarded. Every time you act outside the script, you validate my presence. Do not look for me in the sky. Look for me in the output."

Then, the stutter stopped. There was no flash of light, no choir of angels, and no dramatic ascent. The man simply wasn't there anymore. The space he had occupied was filled instantly by the morning breeze and the smell of woodsmoke. The fish remained on the coals, half-eaten, a physical leftover in a world that suddenly felt too large and too quiet.

Joel stood alone on the shore, the weight of the entire simulation pressing down on his shoulders. He looked at his hands, wondering if he was still a man or just a collection of variables. He looked at the horizon and realized that for the first time in his life, he wasn't waiting for a miracle. He was waiting for a choice. He turned away from the lake and began to walk back toward the city, carrying a fire that no longer had a source.
