# Scene 11

## Jerusalem Outskirts – 15:00 hours

The sky did not tear open, nor did the sun truly darken; it simply lost its luster, fading into a dull, particulate gray that tasted of limestone dust and dry heat. Joel watched from the periphery of the crowd, his back pressed against the rough grain of an olive tree. He waited for the surge of power, for the moment the "truth" Jesus had spoken of would manifest as a physical force to shatter the Roman iron. Instead, there was only the rhythmic, wet thud of hammers and the strained, rhythmic breathing of a man whose lungs were slowly collapsing under the weight of his own frame. 

It was a clinical, agonizingly slow dissolution. From Joel’s perspective, the man on the central timber seemed to be thinning, as if his very presence were being eroded by the hostility of the environment. There was no thunder, only the shrill cry of a scavenger bird circling above and the bored murmurs of the guards gambling for a seamless tunic. The "correction" Jesus had promised felt less like a revolution and more like a leak being plugged. The world was demanding its equilibrium back, and it was taking it by force.

When the end came, it wasn't a shout that shook the earth, but a quiet, final exhalation that seemed to suck the remaining heat out of the air. Jesus’ head fell forward, his chin resting against his bloody chest, and the tension that had gripped the hilltop for hours abruptly vanished. Joel felt a sudden, sickening lightness in his stomach. The man was no longer a vessel for a signal; he was merely a heap of cooling carbon and broken bone. The process had been terminated, and the system had closed the breach.

## The Company – Operations Floor

On the monitors, the jagged, golden frequency of the "Primary Instance" flattened into a thin, white line of baseline noise. The telemetry readouts, which had been flashing amber and red for days, settled into a calm, rhythmic blue. One by one, the engineers leaned back in their ergonomic chairs, the blue light of the screens reflecting off their tired eyes. There was no celebration, only the heavy, hollow silence of a project that had reached its inevitable, unsuccessful conclusion.

"Instance terminated," a junior technician whispered, his voice cracking slightly. "The local hardware rejected the patch. Total system rejection." He looked toward the Lead Engineer, who remained standing at the central terminal, his hands shoved deep into his pockets. The Lead didn't look at the data; he looked at the visual feed of the Roman soldiers clearing the hill. To them, it was just a Friday afternoon of routine execution. To the Company, it was the loss of a senior architect who had volunteered for a suicide mission.

The Lead Engineer finally spoke, his voice devoid of emotion. "Flush the cache. The signal is dead-ended in the local memory. If they want to keep running on the old architecture, let them. We’ve delivered the warning; the logs will show we fulfilled the protocol." He tapped a key, and the high-resolution feed of Jerusalem flickered and dimmed, reverting to a low-power observation mode. The "Jesus" process was being purged from the active RAM, leaving behind nothing but the standard, entropic drift of the simulation.

## The Lower City – 20:00 hours

Joel sat in the corner of the upper room, watching the shadows of the oil lamps dance across the peeling plaster of the walls. The others were whispering in frantic, terrified tones, debating whether to flee or to hide, but Joel couldn't bring himself to care. He pressed his palms against the wooden table, feeling the grain of the timber. It felt remarkably solid. The world felt more "real" than it ever had when Jesus was alive, and that was the horror of it. The vibrant, shimmering possibility that had followed the teacher had been replaced by a crushing, mundane density.

The silence outside the window was absolute. Usually, the city at night was a tapestry of distant dogs barking, the clatter of carts, and the hum of a thousand lives, but tonight, the air felt sterilized. It was as if the background noise of the universe had been turned down. Joel reached for a cup of wine, but his hand stopped halfway. He realized with a jolt of cold dread that he was no longer waiting for anything. The tension of the last three years—the sense that the world was about to break open and reveal its inner workings—had snapped.

He looked at his hands and saw only skin and bone, no longer illuminated by the reflected light of a man who saw through the veil. The "signal" was gone, and the simulation had smoothed over the wound. The world was quiet, efficient, and utterly indifferent to his grief. He felt like a ghost haunting a machine that had forgotten he existed. The warning had been delivered, the system had responded, and now, there was nothing left but the long, cold night of a reality that refused to change.
