# Scene 8

## Midday / A Ruined Toll-Bridge near Vendôme

The Spanish *tercios* moved with a mechanical, soul-crushing precision that the fractured French armies could no longer muster. Their black breastplates, etched with the salt-air of the Netherlands, looked like beetle shells against the grey mist of the Loire. Elouan de Vassy crouched in the skeletal remains of a burnt-out counting house, his fingers numb and stained with a cocktail of dried ink and horse-lather. Beside him, the Marquise Genevieve d'Aubigné—the Iron Widow—sat atop her bay gelding, her charcoal silks shimmering with a cold, metallic light. She did not look like a conspirator; she looked like a monument to a France that refused to die.

The skirmish was brief and brutal. The Marquise’s retainers, hardened Politiques who fought with the quiet desperation of men seeking a middle ground in a world of extremes, struck the Spanish baggage train as it bottlenecked at the bridge. There was no glory in the clash, only the wet thud of pikes finding flesh and the panicked braying of mules. Elouan didn't wait for the dust to settle. He lunged from his hiding place, his boots—now little more than flaps of leather bound by blood-crusted twine—skidding on the slick stones. He ignored the dying moans of a Spanish officer and snatched a heavy, velvet-wrapped bundle from the overturned cart.

As he unwrapped the cloth, the winter sun caught a glimpse of ancient steel. It was the blade of *Joyeuse*, the sword of Charlemagne. It lacked the hilt currently held by the League in Paris, but even as a naked shard of history, it pulsed with a terrifying, silent authority. It was heavy, cold, and smelled faintly of ozone and old tombs. Elouan tucked the relic under his arm alongside his salvaged map cylinder, the weight of the kingdom’s soul pressing hard against his ribs. Behind him, the Marquise gave a sharp whistle, signaling the retreat before the main Spanish column could respond.

## Dusk / The Camp of the White Plume, Loire Valley

The Iron City emerged from the fog like a ghost made of canvas and steel. This was the Camp of the White Plume, a mobile metropolis that smelled of roasting horseflesh, gun oil, and the stern, rhythmic chanting of Huguenot psalms. Here, the "Decaying Renaissance" was stripped of its gold leaf and reduced to its functional core. Noblemen in stained buff coats hammered their own tent pegs, and the fine tapestries of the Valois were used as partitions for field hospitals. It was a place of grim discipline, held together by the singular, magnetic presence of the man they called the Bearnais.

Elouan felt like a specter as he was ushered through the perimeter. His face was a mask of soot and exhaustion, his eyes sunken from days of flight and the lingering terror of Father Thorne’s shadow. The soldiers watched him pass with suspicious, hawk-like gazes, their hands never far from their sword-hilts. To them, he was a "Little Fox," a creature of the ink-pot and the back-alley, yet the Marquise rode at his shoulder, her presence a silent command that kept the pikes lowered.

The camp was a labyrinth of mud-slicked paths and tethered warhorses. As they approached the central pavilion, the atmosphere shifted from the utilitarian grit of the rank-and-file to the frantic energy of a command center. Messengers spurred lathered mounts toward the horizon, and cartographers—men Elouan had once admired from afar—pored over charcoal sketches of the Parisian walls. The weight of the maps in Elouan’s cylinder felt heavier now; they were no longer just lines on vellum, but the blueprint for a slaughter that he alone could facilitate.

## Night / The King’s Pavilion

Inside the pavilion, the air was thick with the scent of pine resin and the heat of a dozen tallow candles. Henri of Navarre stood over a scarred oak table, his white plume tossed carelessly onto a pile of dispatches. He was a man of leather and iron, his beard grey-streaked, his eyes carrying the weary brilliance of a gambler who had bet his life on a single pair of dice. When Elouan stepped forward, the Marquise Genevieve made no move to introduce him; the gravity of the objects he carried spoke for itself.

With trembling hands, Elouan laid the map of the secret Parisian passages onto the table, unrolling it over the King’s own crude charts. The detail was exquisite—every drainage conduit, every weakened section of the medieval masonry, every barricade of the Sixteen was rendered with a precision that made the King catch his breath. Then, with a reverence that felt almost priestly, Elouan placed the blade of *Joyeuse* beside the maps. The naked steel caught the candlelight, casting a long, jagged shadow across the heart of the kingdom.

"The maps to take the city," Elouan whispered, his voice cracking from disuse, "and the steel to keep it." The King reached out, his calloused fingers hovering just inches above the ancient blade. For a moment, the room was silent, the roar of the religious wars muffled by the heavy canvas. The Marquise stepped out of the shadows, her gaze fixed on Elouan with a mixture of pity and triumph. They had provided the Bearnais with the divine legitimacy of a relic and the cold pragmatism of a map. The search for the soul of France had ended here, in a tent filled with smoke, where the ink was finally beginning to dry.
