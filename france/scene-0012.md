# Scene 12

## Sunset – The Quai de l’Horloge, Paris

The bells of Notre Dame no longer rang with the frantic rhythm of an alarm; they had settled into a heavy, rhythmic pulse that vibrated through the very stones of the city. Below the towering cathedral, the streets were a churning river of humanity. The barricades, those jagged skeletons of carts and barrels that had defined the "Radical Maw" for years, were being dismantled by the same hands that had built them. Men in the tattered colors of the Catholic League now stood shoulder-to-shoulder with "Politique" lawyers, their faces masked by a shared, hollow exhaustion. The air was thick with the scent of celebratory bonfires and the lingering, metallic tang of the Seine, which carried the city’s filth toward the sea.

Elouan de Vassy leaned against a damp stone buttress, his breath coming in ragged hitches. His thin tunic was a map of his ordeal: stained with the grey dust of the catacombs, spotted with the blood from his grazed forearm, and soaked with the sweat of a man who had stared into the barrel of an arquebus and lived. At his belt, the heavy brass map cylinder—dented where Father Thorne’s lead ball had struck it—clattered against his thigh. He felt like a ghost haunting his own victory. Just hours ago, he had been a hunted animal in the dark; now, he was a witness to the birth of a new France, one conceived in a cathedral and paid for with a lie.

Through the thinning smoke of the square, the white plume of Henri IV was visible, bobbing like a buoy in a sea of steel. The King rode with a practiced, weary grace, his armor reflecting the dying light of the sun. He did not look like a conqueror; he looked like a man who had finally reached the end of a long, grueling trek. The cries of *"Vive le Roi!"* rose from the crowd, hesitant at first, then swelling into a roar that drowned out the memories of the famine. It was a sound of desperation masquerading as loyalty, a kingdom choosing bread and breath over the purity of the pyre.

## Twilight – The Shadows of the Petit-Bourbon

"You look as though you’ve crawled through the very bowels of the world, Little Fox," a voice spoke from the gloom of a nearby archway. Marquise Genevieve d'Aubigné stepped forward, her mourning silks rustling like dry leaves. Even amidst the chaos, the Iron Widow remained a portrait of composed severity, though the shadows beneath her eyes betrayed the toll of her clandestine wars. She surveyed Elouan’s battered state with a gaze that was both clinical and uncharacteristically soft. "And yet, you are upright. That is more than I expected when the shots rang out from the rafters."

Elouan reached down, his fingers—raw and bleeding—tracing the deep gouge in his brass cylinder. "The map saved me, Madame," he whispered, his voice cracking. "The borders I drew... they stopped a bullet meant for a King. But the King did not win with a sword today. He won with a prayer he does not believe in." He looked toward the Louvre, where the lights were flickering to life for the first time in years. The "Decaying Renaissance" was being patched over with fresh tapestries, but the scars on the stone remained.

Genevieve moved to his side, her hand resting briefly on his shoulder—a rare gesture of solidarity. "France is a fractured mosaic, Elouan. To hold the pieces together, one must use the mortar that is available, even if it is mixed with the dust of compromise." She looked out at the city, where the "Red Capes" were melting into the shadows, their power broken by a King who had simply outbid them for the soul of the people. "The League wanted a martyr; we gave them a Catholic King instead. It is a bitter medicine, but the fever is breaking."

"And what of Father Thorne?" Elouan asked, a shiver running through him at the memory of the Red Shadow’s hollow eyes. "The fanaticism doesn't just vanish because a crown changes heads."

"Thorne is a ghost now, haunting the ruins of his own certainty," Genevieve replied, her voice hardening. "He will find no purchase in a city that is rediscovering the taste of wine and peace. We have traded the fire of the apocalypse for the grey light of the morning." She turned back to Elouan, her expression unreadable. "Go, find a physician for those hands. Your maps are finished, Little Fox. The borders are set, at least for tonight. Let the ink dry before we check if the lines are straight." Elouan nodded slowly, watching as the last of the sun’s gold vanished from the Seine, leaving the kingdom in a quiet, necessary dusk.
