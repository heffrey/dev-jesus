# Scene 1

## Noon, The Barricades of Paris

The fog clinging to the Seine refused to lift, mingling with the acrid smoke of peat fires to create a grey shroud over the city. Elouan de Vassy, known among the desperate and the deviant as the Little Fox, pulled his threadbare cloak tighter against the damp. Beneath the heavy wool, his fingers traced the edges of a leather cylinder—a map of the city’s sewer outlets he had spent three months perfecting. To the Catholic League, it was a blueprint for invasion; to Elouan, it was the only currency that might eventually buy a night of sleep untainted by the smell of rot. He navigated the Barricades of Paris with the practiced ease of a rat, stepping over overturned wine tuns and piles of jagged paving stones that turned the street into a jagged, wooden throat.

The atmosphere in the Radical Maw was thick with a frantic, starving piety. Every few yards, the "Sixteen" had posted broadsheets depicting Henri of Navarre as a multi-headed beast devouring the Host. Elouan kept his gaze fixed on the mud, avoiding the eyes of the citizen-militia who stood atop the barricades with rusted pikes and rosaries wrapped around their knuckles. Hunger had sharpened the city's features; the ribs of the stray dogs showed as clearly as the skeletal rafters of the tenements. Here, a misplaced word or a failure to cross oneself quickly enough was not merely a social gaffe, but a confession of "Politique" sympathies—a death sentence signed in the name of God.

He paused near a vendor selling "bread" made of ground bone and sawdust, his stomach giving a treacherous twist. Before he could move on, the heavy, rhythmic tolling of the bells at Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois began to pulse through the air. It wasn't the call to prayer, but the jagged, uneven rhythm of the *tocsin*. The crowd around him, previously a sluggish tide of misery, suddenly surged forward toward the Place de Grève. Elouan tried to peel away into an alley, but the press of bodies was too great. He was swept along, a leaf in a dark, fanatical current, toward the center of the city’s righteous fury.

## The Place de Grève, The Radical Maw

The square was a sea of mud and black-clad figures, dominated by the timbered silhouette of the scaffold. Standing atop the platform was Father Bastien Thorne, the Red Shadow. His crimson cape was the only vibrant color in the grey afternoon, looking like a fresh arterial spray against the weathered wood of the gallows. Beside him knelt a man Elouan recognized—a clerk from the Châtelet who had once helped him source vellum. The clerk’s face was a mask of bruised pulp, his hands bound behind him with coarse hemp. Thorne did not shout; his voice had a terrifying, quiet clarity that carried over the hushed crowd, fueled by a certainty that required no theatrics.

"The soul of France is a garden," Thorne announced, his hand resting almost tenderly on the clerk’s shoulder. "But the rot of the Politique is a canker that grows in silence, whispering of 'peace' while the heretic king waits at our gates to burn our altars." He looked out over the crowd, his eyes lingering on faces as if searching for the next shadow to purge. Elouan felt the weight of the map against his ribs like a hot coal. He lowered his head, hiding his features behind the collar of his cloak, his heart hammering a frantic rhythm against his chest. He was a cartographer of borders, but in this square, the only border that mattered was the one between the faithful and the dead.

With a sharp nod from Thorne, the executioner stepped forward. There was no grand speech from the condemned, only a wet, sobbing plea that was cut short by the sudden drop of the trapdoor. The sound of the rope snapping taut was a dull crack that echoed off the surrounding stone facades. The crowd erupted into a discordant cheer, a mixture of religious ecstasy and the primal relief of those who had survived another day of the purge. Thorne remained motionless, a sentinel of the League’s iron will, his gaze fixed on the swinging body as if watching the departure of a demon. Elouan turned and forced his way through the cheering throng, his hands trembling as he sought the safety of the shadows, knowing that in the eyes of the Red Shadow, his maps were nothing more than a confession waiting to be written.
