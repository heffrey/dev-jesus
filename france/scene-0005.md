# Scene 5

## Late Afternoon - The Chateau de Vauroux, Loire Valley

The Chateau de Vauroux was a skeleton of limestone and slate, its western wing collapsed into a heap of rubble that resembled a toothless grin. Once a jewel of the Loire, it had been traded between the League and the Huguenots four times in as many years, leaving it a hollowed-rye husk. Elouan de Vassy leaned against a soot-stained sundial in the overgrown courtyard, his lungs burning with the sharp, autumnal air. He was a creature of mud and tremors, his boots worn through and his fingers stained with the grime of the road. The "White Plume" camp lay miles to the south, a smudge of smoke on the horizon, but this ruin was the designated waypoint for the Politique network.

A pair of sentries in mismatched breastplates emerged from the shadows of the vaulted entrance. They did not wear the red capes of Father Thorne’s inquisitors, nor the austere black of the Huguenot zealots. Instead, they wore the faded blue sashes of the moderates—men who fought for a king, not a god. They searched Elouan with a weary efficiency, their hands lingering on the leather cylinder strapped to his chest. Finding only the maps and the tools of a cartographer, they gestured him toward the grand staircase, where the scent of expensive beeswax struggled against the pervasive odor of damp rot.

In the solar, the Marquise Genevieve d'Aubigné sat before a hearth that lacked a fire. She was draped in heavy charcoal silks, her face a pale cameo of resolve amidst the decaying grandeur. The "Iron Widow" did not rise as Elouan entered; she merely watched him with eyes that had seen the Valois line wither and the Seine turn red. On the table before her lay a map of Paris, its edges curled like scorched skin. Beside it sat a single glass of wine, dark as a bruised plum, which she pushed toward the trembling young man.

## The Solar of the Iron Widow

"Drink, Little Fox," Genevieve said, her voice a low, resonant cello in the drafty room. "You have the look of a man who has tasted too much of the earth and too little of the vine." Elouan obeyed, the wine searing his throat and bringing a flush of heat to his cold-stiffened limbs. With shaking hands, he unfastened the leather cylinder and laid the vellum maps upon the table. He traced the lines he had drawn in the flickering candlelight of his garret—the secret conduits, the crumbling sections of the medieval wall, the paths that bypassed the radical barricades of the Sixteen.

"The way is clear, Madame," Elouan whispered, his voice cracking. "I have marked the shadows where the Red Capes do not tread. If Henri moves now, before the Spanish tercios fully entrench, the city can be taken. The Politiques within the walls are ready to open the gates." He looked at her, desperate for the relief of a completed mission, for the permission to simply sleep. He had survived the mud of No Man’s Land and the mark of Father Thorne for these lines of ink, believing they were the key to ending the madness.

The Marquise did not look at the maps. Instead, she reached into the folds of her gown and produced a crumpled missive, sealed with the same stylized owl crest Elouan had seen in his garret. "The maps are a masterpiece, Elouan. They are the body of our ambition," she said, her gaze fixed on him with a pity that chilled him more than the autumn wind. "But a body without a soul is merely a corpse. Three nights ago, the treasury of Saint-Denis was violated. The League did not take the gold or the plate. They took Joyeuse. The Sword of Charlemagne is gone."

## The Weight of Gold and Bone

The silence that followed was heavier than the stones of the chateau. Elouan felt the world tilt; the maps, his "marrow of the kingdom," suddenly looked like nothing more than child’s drawings. In this age of fanaticism, a king was not made by strategy alone, but by the divine theater of relics. Without Joyeuse to gird his hip at a coronation, Henri of Navarre would remain a heretic pretender in the eyes of the wavering masses. The League, led by the Duke of Mayenne and whispered to by Father Thorne, would use the stolen blade to sanctify a puppet, turning the history of France against its own future.

"The message you carried is a ghost," Genevieve continued, rising at last. She walked to the window, looking out toward the distant fires of the White Plume. "The gates of Paris will not open for a king who carries a common rapier. The moderates will not risk the gallows for a man who lacks the mandate of the Carolingians. To save the kingdom, we must find the steel that forged it. My agents track a path of blood leading toward the ruins of the south. The sword is being moved to a League stronghold, perhaps to be blessed by a Spanish cardinal."

She turned back to Elouan, her expression hardening into the iron that gave her her name. "You are a cartographer, Little Fox. You understand the shape of the land better than any soldier. You will not go to the King’s camp. You will follow the trail of the thieves. The pilgrimage of steel begins now, and you will be the eyes that find the way." Elouan looked down at his ruined hands, then at the maps he had nearly died to deliver. The war had changed its shape; it was no longer a matter of walls and pikes, but a hunt for a shadow in a land of ruins.
