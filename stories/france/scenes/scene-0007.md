# Scene 7

## Midnight / A Requisitioned Coaching Inn, Three Leagues from Paris

The interior of the "Le Cerf Blanc" smelled of wet wool, stale ale, and the sharp, cloying scent of frankincense that followed Father Bastien Thorne like a funeral shroud. Elouan de Vassy sat slumped in a high-backed chair, his wrists bound with hempen rope that bit into his ink-stained skin. His boots, still held together by the frayed twine from his flight through the Orne Valley, were caked in a layer of frozen sludge. Every breath felt like inhaling shards of glass; the exhaustion of the road had finally collapsed upon him, leaving him a hollowed-out vessel of fear and shivering nerves.

Before him, the leather cylinder containing his precious maps lay on a scarred oak table, its contents spilled out under the flickering light of a single tallow candle. Father Thorne—the Red Shadow—moved with a predatory grace that defied his priestly robes. He didn't look like a man of God; he looked like a blade tempered in the fires of the Inquisition. His red cape, heavy with the damp of the night, swept across the floorboards like a trail of drying blood. He picked up one of Elouan’s vellum charts, tracing the secret conduits of Paris with a gloved finger.

"You have a gift for perspective, Master de Vassy," Thorne whispered, his voice a low rasp that vibrated in the small room. "You see the world as it is—a series of lines, borders, and barriers. But you fail to see the rot beneath the vellum. You map the city's veins, yet you seek to pump the poison of a heretic king through them. Tell me, does Henri of Navarre promise you a paradise of ink, or merely a grave in the mud?"

## The Hour of the Wolf / The Cellar of the Cerf Blanc

The interrogation shifted from the intellectual to the visceral as Thorne moved the candle closer to Elouan’s face. The heat was a physical weight, highlighting the cartographer’s sunken eyes and the trembling of his jaw. Thorne didn't use the rack or the iron; he used the quiet, terrifying certainty of a man who believed he was saving a soul by breaking a body. He spoke of the "Sixteen" and the purges in Paris, describing the bodies hanging from the lanterns as a necessary harvest. He wanted the names of the Politique contacts who had facilitated Elouan’s journey—specifically the "Iron Widow" who pulled the strings from the shadows.

"The Marquise Genevieve d'Aubigné is a ghost haunting a collapsing house," Thorne said, leaning in so close that Elouan could smell the wine on his breath. "She uses boys like you as kindling for her pragmatism. She does not care for the Cross, only for the crown. Tell me where the stolen Joyeuse is being taken. The League has the hilt, but the blade... the blade is moving. Where did she tell you to meet the thieves?"

Elouan bit his lip until he tasted the metallic tang of blood, his mind racing through the geometric patterns of his maps to avoid the priest’s piercing gaze. He thought of the ruined Chateau de Vauroux and the weight of the "Little Fox" moniker. He was a creature of the margins, a man of borders, but here, in the dark, there were no lines to hide behind. "I am a cartographer, Father," Elouan rasped, his voice cracking. "I draw where things are. I do not know where they are going. Borders change with the tide of war. I only record the wreckage."

## Pre-Dawn / The Perimeter of the Inn

The tension broke not with a confession, but with the sudden, rhythmic tolling of a nearby village bell—a frantic, uneven alarm that signaled fire. Outside, the muffled shouts of the Red Cape sentries erupted into chaos. A sudden orange glow flared against the frosted windowpanes as the hayloft of the inn’s stable went up in a roar of flame. The distraction was surgical: a calculated burst of violence designed to draw the Inquisitors away from the main building. Through the window, the silhouette of a rider in charcoal silks could be seen momentarily against the firelight, a spectral presence overseeing the disorder.

Marquise Genevieve d'Aubigné did not strike with pikes; she struck with the environment. Within moments, the "Politique" network’s handiwork was evident as a group of local *croquants*, likely bribed with the very gold the League used to pay its mercenaries, began a rowdy skirmish with the Red Capes in the yard. The confusion was total. Thorne hissed a curse, his eyes darting from Elouan to the maps on the table. For a second, the zealot wavered between his prey and his duty to the League’s security.

"The Iron Widow’s touch," Thorne spat, grabbing the leather cylinder but leaving the loose vellum scattered in his haste. He turned to signal his men, but the door burst open as a thick cloud of woodsmoke rolled in, followed by the heavy tread of someone who moved with the authority of the "Politique Muse." Elouan, left bound in the chair, watched as the Red Shadow was forced to retreat into the burning night, leaving the cartographer in the precarious balance between a rescuer he didn't fully trust and an inquisitor who would surely return. The search for *Joyeuse* had become a race through a kingdom that was burning itself to the ground.
