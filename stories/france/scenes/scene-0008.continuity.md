- **Objects**: The hiltless blade of *Joyeuse* (Charlemagne’s sword, wrapped in velvet, smells of ozone) and a map cylinder containing precise blueprints of Paris’s secret passages and defenses.
- **Character state (Elouan)**: Exhausted and soot-covered; eyes sunken; voice cracking; wearing boots made of leather scraps and twine.
