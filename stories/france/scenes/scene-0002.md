# Scene 2

## Late Afternoon | The Barricades of Paris (also known as: The Radical Maw)

The echoes of the executioner’s blade still vibrated in Elouan’s teeth as he slipped away from the Place de Grève. He moved like a shadow through the Radical Maw, his boots slick with the grey slush of the streets. Here, the city was no longer a collection of homes but a series of jagged wounds, held together by the heavy iron chains and overturned carts of the Barricades. The air was thick with the scent of wet ash and the sour, yeasty smell of the "bone bread" being baked in communal ovens—a desperate slurry of ground skeletal remains and sawdust that did little to quiet the gnawing ache in his stomach.

Elouan clutched the leather cylinder beneath his cloak as if it were a shield. Every turn through the labyrinthine streets felt like a gamble. To his left, a group of citizen-militia warmed their hands over a brazier fueled by the legs of a Louis XII chair; to his right, a Jesuit priest harangued a crowd of hollow-cheeked women about the divine necessity of starvation. He kept his eyes down, his hood pulled low, playing the part of the "Little Fox" he had become—a creature of the hedgerows and the hidden corners, invisible to the predators who hunted in the open.

He reached the Rue Saint-Antoine, where the grand townhouse of the d'Aubigné family stood like a picked-over carcass. Its windows were boarded with rough pine, and the family crest above the lintel had been defaced with a smear of red paint—the mark of those under surveillance by the Sixteen. He did not enter through the front. Instead, he ducked into a narrow alleyway where a loose stone in the foundation gave way to a descent into the dark. The dampness of the earth rose to meet him, smelling of ancient stone and the slow rot of the city's foundations.

## Dusk | The Cellar of the Iron Widow (also known as: The Politique Library)

The cellar was illuminated by the amber flicker of a single tallow candle, casting long, dancing shadows against walls lined with crates of contraband books and maps. Marquise Genevieve d'Aubigné sat at a scarred oak table, her mourning silks dusty but impeccably pinned. She was the Iron Widow, a woman whose husband had fallen at the St. Bartholomew’s Day massacre and whose resolve had only hardened in the twenty years since. She was currently studying a ledger, her quill scratching with the rhythmic precision of a ticking clock.

"You are late, Elouan," she said without looking up, her voice a low, melodic rasp that commanded the stillness of the room. "I began to fear the Red Shadow had finally caught your scent at the Grève."

Elouan stepped into the circle of light, his breath hitching as he placed the leather cylinder on the table. "Thorne was there. He watched the clerk die as if he were observing a Mass. I... I had to wait for the crowd to disperse." He wiped a bead of cold sweat from his brow, his fingers trembling. "The city is a tinderbox, Madame. One more spark and the Seine will run red again."

Genevieve reached out, her pale hand resting on the cylinder. She looked at him then, her eyes sharp and obsidian, holding the weary wisdom of the Politique network. "Which is why we must provide the water to quench it, Little Fox. The King is at the gates, but he is blind to the way in. He sees only the walls and the pikes of the Spanish tercios. He does not see the veins of the city—the passages that the League has forgotten and the Sixteen have never mapped."

## Evening | The Secret Map (also known as: The Courier’s Burden)

With a practiced motion, Genevieve unrolled the parchment Elouan had brought. It was a masterpiece of clandestine cartography, showing the subterranean outlets where the city’s filth met the river, specifically a forgotten postern gate near the Tour de Nesle. She laid a second, smaller map beside it—a delicate vellum sheet marked with the sigil of the Bearnais. "These are the keys to Paris," she whispered. "The League believes their piety makes them invincible, but they have forgotten that the earth beneath them is old and indifferent to their dogma."

She looked at Elouan with a gravity that made the small cellar feel even more claustrophobic. "You must take these to the Camp of the White Plume. Henri must know that the moderates within the city are ready to open the gates, provided he promises the Edict of tolerance we have labored for. If you are caught with these, Thorne will not give you the mercy of a quick blade. He will peel the secrets from you inch by inch."

Elouan looked at the maps—the ink lines that represented his only hope for a France where he could draw borders for peace rather than war. He felt the weight of the mission settling onto his narrow shoulders, a burden heavier than any stone in the barricades. "And if I fail?" he asked, his voice barely a whisper.

"Then the Spanish Infanta will sit on the throne, the Inquisition will set up its stalls in the Louvre, and the name of France will be a memory buried under the mud," Genevieve replied, her hand closing over his. "Go now. The moon is obscured by the smoke of the siege fires. It is a good night for a fox to run."
