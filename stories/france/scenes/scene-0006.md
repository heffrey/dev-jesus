# Scene 6

## Dusk / The Desecrated Abbey of Saint-Céneri, Orne Valley
The Abbey of Saint-Céneri clung to the jagged cliffs above the Sarthe River like a skeletal hand gripping a throat. Once a jewel of Romanesque grace, the wars had stripped it of its finery. Its stained glass had been shattered by Huguenot stones years prior, and its lead roofing had been melted down into League bullets. Elouan de Vassy, his boots now little more than flaps of salt-stained leather held together by twine, watched the abbey from the treeline. The air was frigid, carrying the scent of wet slate and the biting iron of the river below.

Elouan’s fingers, permanently stained with the sepia ink of his trade, traced the edge of the leather cylinder slung across his chest. He was no longer just a messenger of maps; he was a hunter of ghosts. The "Iron Widow," Genevieve d'Aubigné, had been clear: the League had moved the stolen sword, *Joyeuse*, through this valley, seeking to spirit it toward the Spanish lines in the north. The "Little Fox" felt his pulse thrumming in his ears, a frantic rhythm that matched the flickering torchlight dancing within the abbey’s ruined nave.

He moved with the practiced silence of a man who had spent his life measuring the world in inches. He bypassed the main gate, where the mud was churned by the heavy hooves of warhorses, and instead sought the gardener’s postern—a narrow breach he had noted on a royal survey years ago. The stone was slick with moss, and the wind howled through the empty bell tower like a choir of the damned, masking the sound of his ragged breathing as he slipped into the shadows of the ambulatory.

## Midnight / The Cloisters of the Silent Word
Inside, the abbey was a labyrinth of "Decaying Renaissance" opulence and martial filth. Mounds of damp straw were piled beneath frescoes of the saints, and the smell of roasting horseflesh drifted from the refectory. Elouan pressed his back against a cold marble pillar, his heart hammering as a group of men-at-arms passed. They wore the tattered surcoats of the League, but over them, the distinctive crimson capes that signaled the presence of the Inquisition. Father Bastien Thorne was here.

The "Red Shadow" was not a man who left things to chance. Elouan watched from the gallery as Thorne paced the center of the cloisters, his tall, angular frame casting a distorted silhouette against the moonlit flagstones. Thorne held a heavy iron rosary, the beads clicking like the cocking of a wheellock pistol. Beside him, a wooden crate sat atop a stone sarcophagus, its lid pried open to reveal a lining of tarnished blue velvet. It was empty. The sword—the soul of France—had been moved again, or perhaps it was being prepared for its final journey to Paris.

"He is close," Thorne’s voice rang out, cold and resonant as a funeral bell. He did not look up, yet Elouan felt the weight of the Inquisitor’s gaze as if it were a physical blade. "The Little Fox thinks in lines and angles, but he forgets that God sees the circle. Search the ossuary. If he carries the maps of the Widow, bring me his hands first. The rest of him is of no use to the Heavens." The Red Capes fanned out, their pikes scraping against the stone, the metallic screech setting Elouan’s teeth on edge.

## Pre-Dawn / The Crypt of the Forgotten Kings
Elouan descended into the bowels of the abbey, guided by the geometric memory of the building's blueprint. The air grew thick with the smell of ancient dust and the sweet, cloying rot of the catacombs. He found the crate’s discarded wrappings near a stack of ancestral coffins—scraps of gold thread and a single, heavy seal bearing the fleur-de-lis. His breath hitched. They were treating the relic like common contraband, a pawn in a game of blood-soaked mud. 

A floorboard creaked above him. The Red Capes were closing the net. Elouan scrambled into a narrow drainage conduit, his chest heaving as he squeezed through the damp stone passage. He could hear the heavy thud of Thorne’s boots on the stairs above, the rhythmic click-clack of the rosary beads drawing nearer. The Inquisitor was a predator of faith, and Elouan was merely a man of ink; yet, as he felt the cold water of the Sarthe seep into his sleeves, the cartographer realized that the lines he drew were the only thing keeping the kingdom from falling off the edge of the world.

He emerged onto a narrow ledge overlooking the churning river, the gray light of a winter dawn beginning to bleed over the horizon. He had no sword, and the enemy held the abbey, but he had seen the direction of the wagon tracks in the mud of the courtyard before the light failed. They were heading toward the "Radical Maw" of Paris. With a final look at the darkened silhouette of the abbey, Elouan plunged into the thickets, the "Pilgrimage of Steel" leading him back toward the very city he had barely escaped.
