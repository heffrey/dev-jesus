# Scene 3

## Nightfall; The Latin Quarter, Rue de la Harpe

The door to Elouan de Vassy’s garret did not groan; it shattered. The wood, brittle from a winter of neglect and the leaching damp of the Seine, gave way under the iron-shod boot of a League zealot. Father Bastien Thorne stepped over the splinters, his crimson cape swirling like a fresh wound in the dim candlelight of the hallway. He did not rush. The Red Shadow moved with the terrifying patience of a man who believed time was merely a tool of the divine. Inside, the room smelled of stale ink, drying vellum, and the sharp, metallic tang of a guttering tallow candle.

The space was a skeletal remains of a life. A narrow cot, a desk cluttered with compasses and quill-nibs, and a single window overlooking the jagged skyline of the Barricades. Thorne walked to the desk, his gloved hand hovering over the surface. He pressed his fingers to the candle’s wick; it was still soft, the wax yielding and warm. The Little Fox had fled, likely slipping through the crawlspace beneath the eaves just as the Red Capes had breached the lower landing. A thin smile touched Thorne’s lips—a expression devoid of warmth, as cold as the stone of Notre Dame.

"He is gone, Father," one of the militiamen spat, his breath heavy with the scent of the sour wine and bone-bread that sustained the city’s defenders. The man began to overturn the cot, slashing the thin mattress with a dagger in search of hidden correspondence. Thorne ignored the violence. He was not looking for gold or steel; he was looking for the geometry of treason. He picked up a discarded scrap of parchment, a failed sketch of the Rue Saint-Jacques, and held it to the light. The lines were too precise, too clean for a mere student. They were the marks of a man who saw the city as a lock waiting for a key.

## Midnight; Within the Cartographer’s Cell

Thorne’s methodical search eventually led him to the hearth. The ashes were cold, but amidst the grey flakes of burnt waste, a stubborn fragment of heavy vellum remained unconsumed. He retrieved it with a pair of silver tongs, his eyes narrowing as he brushed away the soot. It was a corner of a ledger, charred at the edges, bearing a distinctive wax seal—not the fleur-de-lis of the crown, but the subtle, embossed crest of a stylized owl. It was the mark of the Politique network, a symbol Thorne had seen once before in a confiscated letter from the Loire.

"The Iron Widow," Thorne whispered, the name tasting like bile. He recognized the elegant, slanted script of the notations on the fragment. They weren't coordinates for a siege, but a list of names—prominent lawyers of the Parlement and disillusioned merchants of the Sixteen. It was a map of a different sort: a social cartography of the moderate rot festering within the League’s own heart. By following the Little Fox, he had stumbled upon the threads that led directly to the Marquise Genevieve d'Aubigné. The girl was not merely a sympathizer; she was the loom on which this tapestry of betrayal was being woven.

Outside, the bells of Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois began to toll, a mournful sound that echoed through the Radical Maw of the streets below. Thorne turned to his men, his face illuminated by the flickering torchlight, casting long, distorted shadows against the maps pinned to the walls. "Seal the district," he commanded, his voice a low rasp. "The cartographer is a ghost, but the Marquise is flesh and blood. If we cannot catch the fox in his hole, we shall burn the forest that shields him. Paris will be purified, even if we must turn every townhouse into a pyre." He tucked the charred fragment into his belt, the Red Shadow already calculating the distance to the d'Aubigné estate.
