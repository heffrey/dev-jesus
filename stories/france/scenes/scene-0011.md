# Scene 11

**Act 3: The Altar of the Seine**
**Scene 11: The Forest of Oak and Iron**

## Sunset; The Triforium of Notre Dame Cathedral

The "Forest"—the ancient, skeletal timber framework of the cathedral’s roof—sighed under the weight of centuries and the rising heat of ten thousand candles below. Elouan de Vassy climbed with fingers that bled, his twine-bound boots slipping against the dust-slicked oak beams. Below him, the vast cavern of the nave was a sea of shifting shadows and flickering light, the air thick with the cloying sweetness of frankincense and the rhythmic, guttural chanting of the *Te Deum*. He felt like a mite crawling across the ribs of a gargantuan, dying beast.

High above the high altar, the shadows were deepest. Elouan’s breath came in ragged, shallow hitches, his thin tunic damp with a cold sweat that had nothing to do with the humidity of the evening. He could see the "white plume" of Henri of Navarre—now Henri IV—kneeling before the Archbishop. From this height, the King looked fragile, a solitary figure of velvet and steel attempting to stitch a shroud into a coronation robe. The "Paris is worth a Mass" strategy was unfolding in a theater of gold and stone, but the script was about to be rewritten in lead.

A spark of flint struck metal echoed through the rafters, a sharp, mechanical sound that cut through the choral drone. Elouan froze, his gaze locking onto a silhouette perched precariously on a cross-beam near the rose window. Father Bastien Thorne, the Red Shadow, was a study in lethal stillness. The Inquisitor had discarded his crimson cloak for a soot-black habit that bled into the darkness, his long-barreled arquebus resting on a leather-wrapped strut. The weapon’s muzzle pointed downward, a finger of iron aimed directly at the King’s bared neck.

## Twilight; The Rafters Above the High Altar

"The maps did not lie, Little Fox," Thorne said, his voice a dry rasp that barely carried over the vibration of the great organ. He did not turn his head; his eye remained pressed to the sight of the arquebus. "You charted the secret passages of the city so that a heretic might walk through them. You have used your gift to draw a path for the Antichrist."

Elouan lunged forward, not with the grace of a soldier, but with the desperate clumsiness of a man who had spent his life over parchment. He caught a support beam to steady himself, his heart hammering against his ribs like a trapped bird. "It isn't about the King, Father," Elouan wheezed, his sunken eyes bright with terror. "It’s about the lines. If he dies here, the borders of France will be drawn in the blood of children for another thirty years. I want the ink to dry. I want the killing to stop."

Thorne adjusted the slow-match, the glowing coal casting a demonic orange light across his hollowed features. "Peace without purity is merely a slow rot," the priest countered, his finger tightening on the trigger. "God demands a winnowing. If the Seine must run red to wash away the stain of the Huguenot, then let it flow. I am the surgeon, Elouan. You are merely the fly buzzing in the operating theater."

## Nightfall; The Vaults of the Cathedral

As the choir reached a crescendo, Thorne braced his shoulder for the recoil. Elouan didn't reach for a blade; he reached for the map cylinder at his belt—the heavy brass tube that had been his only constant companion. With a primal cry, he swung the cylinder, not at Thorne, but at the arquebus’s long barrel. The metal shrieked as it collided, knocking the aim wide a fraction of a second before the flash of black powder ignited the air.

The roar of the shot was swallowed by the organ’s thunder, but the heavy ball struck a stone pillar yards away from the King, sending a spray of limestone dust into the choir. Thorne snarled, dropping the spent firearm and lunging at Elouan with a jagged misericorde. They grappled in the dark, two shadows dancing on a tightrope of ancient wood. Elouan felt the cold bite of the priest’s dagger graze his forearm, but he clung to Thorne’s wrist with the strength of the truly terrified.

"Look down!" Elouan screamed, shoving the priest toward the edge of the timber walkway. Below, the King had risen, unharmed, and the crowd was erupting not in panic, but in a roar of "Vive le Roi!" The light from the nave flooded upward, illuminating Thorne’s face—a mask of shattered certainty. The martyrdom he had envisioned had been traded for a clumsy failure in the dust. Elouan held the priest over the abyss, both of them trembling. "The map has changed, Bastien. There is no room for your shadows in the France that is coming." Thorne looked down at the tarnished gold of the altar, then back at the boy, his fanatical fire guttering out into a hollow, silent void.
