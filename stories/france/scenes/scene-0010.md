# Scene 10

## Midday - The Bastion of the Sixteen (The Barricades of Paris)

Father Bastien Thorne stood by a narrow arrow-slit in a requisitioned townhouse near the Place de Grève, his silhouette a jagged tear against the pale light. Below, the Barricades of Paris remained—a chaotic architecture of overturned carts and barrels filled with the heavy, damp earth of the Seine—but the fervor that had built them was curdling into a desperate, hollow silence. The news of Henri’s impending conversion had spread through the city like a slow-acting poison, turning the League’s radical certainty into a panicked tremor. Thorne’s fingers, stained with the ink of proscription lists and the faint, lingering scent of sacrificial wax, gripped the hilt of a dagger hidden beneath his crimson-lined robes.

"The Bearnais thinks a splash of holy water will wash away the rot of heresy," Thorne hissed to the shadow of a Red Cape standing by the door. "He thinks the gates of Notre Dame will swing open for a king who trades his soul for a crown of earthly gold." The Inquisitor turned, his eyes burning with the cold, white light of a man who had already seen the end of the world. To Thorne, the "Paris is worth a Mass" strategy was not a political compromise; it was the ultimate blasphemy, a theatrical farce that demanded a violent, sanctified finale.

The plot was already in motion. While the Duke of Mayenne wavered and the Spanish *tercios* shifted their pikes in uncertainty, Thorne had mobilized the last of the true believers. They would not meet Henri on the battlefield, where his white plume reigned supreme, but at the very altar where he sought his crown. During the *Te Deum*, when the incense was thickest and the bells of the city drowned out the cries of the skeptics, the Red Shadow would strike. It was a plan born of the radical pulpits, a jagged shard of fanaticism intended to shatter the fragile peace before it could ever take root.

## Afternoon - The Politique Cellar (Rue de l'Arbre-Sec)

In the gloom of the vaulted cellar, Marquise Genevieve d'Aubigné adjusted the heavy charcoal silks of her mourning dress, her face a mask of iron resolve. Before her, Elouan de Vassy sat on a crate, his hands trembling as he traced a charcoal line over a yellowed parchment. The map spread between them was not of the city above, but of the skeletal world beneath—the ancient Roman quarries and the ossuaries that honeycombed the belly of Paris. The "Little Fox" looked more like a ghost than a courier; his eyes were sunken, and his breath came in shallow, anxious hitches, yet his fingers moved with the frantic precision of a man who knew the geometry of survival.

"Thorne has vanished from the League’s council," Genevieve said, her voice a low, commanding rasp that cut through the damp air. "My contacts within the Red Capes report a movement toward the cathedral’s foundations. They aren't planning a protest, Elouan. They are planning a martyrdom." She placed a hand on his shoulder, the weight of her rings cold through his thin tunic. The Politique network had done their work—the bribes were paid, the lists were flipped—but all their diplomacy would bleed out on the cathedral floor if the Inquisitor reached the King first.

Elouan looked down at his boots, the leather scraps and twine barely holding together against the grime of the city. He was no soldier, and the thought of the catacombs—the dark, airless tunnels where the dead of centuries watched the living—made his heart hammer against his ribs like a trapped bird. "The streets are a labyrinth of pikes and paranoia," he whispered, his voice cracking. "I can reach the choir of Notre Dame from below, through the old Bishop’s passage. But if the Red Capes are already there..." He didn't finish the sentence, the map cylinder clutched in his lap like a holy relic.

## Sunset - The Catacombs of Saint-Innocent

The air in the catacombs was thick with the scent of wet limestone and the ancient, earthy rot of the "Radical Maw." Elouan moved through the darkness, his only light a stuttering tallow candle that cast elongated, dancing shadows against the walls of stacked femurs and grinning skulls. Every drip of water from the vaulted ceiling sounded like a footfall; every shift of the earth felt like the city above groaning under the weight of its own sins. He was deep beneath the Barricades now, navigating a world where the borders were drawn in bone rather than ink.

As he neared the passage that led toward the foundations of the Seine, a flicker of light appeared ahead—not the warm glow of a candle, but the harsh, rhythmic pulse of a torch. Elouan pressed his back against a cold wall of masonry, his heart thundering. In the distance, the muffled, rhythmic booming of the bells began—the first tolling for the *Te Deum*. The sound vibrated through the very stones of the catacombs, a heavy, metallic heartbeat that signaled the King’s approach to the city gates.

He saw them then: a file of men in crimson-lined cloaks, their faces obscured by the shadows of the tunnels. At their head was Father Bastien Thorne, the "Red Shadow" himself, carrying a long-barreled arquebus wrapped in oilcloth. They were moving with the grim, disciplined zeal of men who expected to die, their path leading directly toward the hidden staircase that rose into the heart of Notre Dame. Elouan gripped the edge of his map, his knuckles white. The Cartographer was alone in the dark with the wolves of the League, and the only bridge left to save France was a narrow passage through the kingdom of the dead.
