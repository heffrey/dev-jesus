# Scene 4

## Pre-dawn: The Barricades of Paris (The Radical Maw)

The sky over Paris was not black, but a bruised, sulfurous orange, lit from the outside by the rhythmic belching of Spanish cannons and from within by the watchfires of the League. Elouan de Vassy pressed his spine against the rough timber of an overturned wine cart, his breath coming in ragged, shallow hitches. The "Radical Maw" lived up to its name; the street was a choked gullet of jagged paving stones, heavy iron chains, and barrels filled with the excrement and rubble of a dying city. Every few minutes, the ground shuddered as a heavy shot from the Duke of Parma’s batteries struck the outer fortifications, sending a rain of soot and ancient mortar falling like black snow onto Elouan’s trembling shoulders.

In his sweat-slicked hand, the leather cylinder felt like a lead weight. It contained the maps—the literal marrow of the kingdom—and the scent of the vellum seemed to draw the attention of the starving curs prowling the shadows. Elouan’s stomach gave a treacherous, hollow growl, a reminder of the "bone bread" he had refused to eat. Around him, the city breathed with a sickly, collective wheeze. He could hear the low, rhythmic chanting of a group of penitents three streets over, their voices rising in a dissonant plea for divine intervention against the "Heretic Bearnais" who sat at their gates. 

A sudden flare of light from a Spanish mortar shell illuminated the barricade, casting long, skeletal shadows against the boarded-up windows of the Rue Saint-Jacques. In that flash, Elouan saw them: the "Red Capes." A squad of Father Bastien Thorne’s men was picking through the debris fifty yards away, their halberds glinting with a cold, predatory light. They weren't looking for Spanish spies; they were looking for him. "The Little Fox," they called him in the taverns of the Sixteen, a vermin to be smoked out. Elouan squeezed his eyes shut, prayed to a God he hoped was still listening to cartographers, and began to crawl through the mud toward the base of the ramparts.

## Dawn: The Ramparts of the Porte Saint-Jacques

The ascent was a nightmare of slick stone and rusted iron. Elouan used the gaps in the medieval masonry—weak points he had noted on his own clandestine charts—to haul himself upward. Below him, the city was a cauldron of smoke; above him, the cold wind of the open country promised a freedom that felt like an illusion. As he reached the crenellated walkway of the curtain wall, a Spanish shell whistled overhead, screaming like a banshee before slamming into a granary near the center of the city. The explosion threw Elouan flat against the cold stone, his ears ringing with the metallic tang of black powder and pulverized rock.

Through the haze of dust and the stinging smoke, Elouan looked back toward the heart of the city. High atop the watchtower of the Porte Saint-Jacques stood a figure as still as a tombstone. It was Father Bastien Thorne. The Red Shadow’s heavy cloak whipped violently in the wind, a splash of arterial blood against the grey dawn. Thorne did not shout; he did not signal the archers. He simply stood with his hands clasped behind his back, his pale, hawk-like features illuminated by the fires of the bombardment. His gaze locked onto Elouan’s with a terrifying, quiet certainty—the look of a man who was not losing a prey, but merely lengthening the tether.

Elouan felt a chill that had nothing to do with the morning mist. He knew that Thorne had seen the leather cylinder, had recognized the desperate silhouette of the Little Fox. With a final, lung-burning effort, Elouan threw himself over the outer lip of the rampart, sliding down a steep embankment of loose earth and frozen mud that led toward the No Man’s Land beyond the walls. As he tumbled into the darkness of the valley, the last thing he saw was Thorne’s hand slowly rising to trace the sign of the cross in the air—not a blessing, but a mark of death. Elouan hit the bottom of the trench, his boots sinking into the blood-soaked mud of France, and began to run toward the distant, flickering campfires of the White Plume.
