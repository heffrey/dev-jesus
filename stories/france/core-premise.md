The year is 1592, and the Kingdom of France is a fractured mosaic of blood-soaked mud and tarnished gold. The air is thick with the scent of woodsmoke, black powder, and the metallic tang of the Seine. After decades of the Wars of Religion, the land is exhausted, yet the fires of fanaticism refuse to dim. 

**The Setting: A Kingdom Divided**
In the north, the Catholic League holds Paris in a stranglehold of piety and paranoia. The city is a fortress of barricades and bells, governed by "The Sixteen," a radical council of citizens who purge any suspected of "Politique" sympathies—those moderates who value peace over dogma. The Louvre stands cold, its halls haunted by the ghosts of the Valois dynasty, while the Spanish Infanta Clara Eugenia is whispered as a potential puppet queen, supported by the steel of Philip II’s veteran *tercios* camped on the outskirts.

To the south and west, the "Bearnais," Henri of Navarre—the Protestant claimant to the throne—leads a nomadic court of iron and leather. His camp is a mobile city of Huguenot psalms and clashing steel, perpetually on the move through the Loire Valley and Normandy. He is a king without a capital, besieging his own kingdom to save it, his white plume a beacon on the smoke-filled battlefields of Ivry and Rouen.

**The Atmosphere: Grit and Grandeur**
The aesthetic is one of "Decaying Renaissance." Magnificent chateaus, their facades scarred by cannon fire, are repurposed as barracks. Tapestries are used to patch holes in roofs, and the fine silks of the nobility are stained with the grime of the siege lines. The roads are treacherous, haunted by *croquants* (peasant rebels) and deserters from five different armies. In the village squares, the printing press is a weapon more dangerous than the pike, churning out vitriolic pamphlets and prophecies of the apocalypse.

**Key Factions and Players**
*   **The Catholic League (The Guise Faction):** Led by the Duke of Mayenne, they are fueled by Spanish gold and Jesuit fervor. They operate out of the radicalized pulpits of Paris, convinced that a heretic king is a death sentence for the soul of France.
*   **The Royalist Huguenots:** Hardened veterans of the religious wars who see Henri as the only hope for religious tolerance and national sovereignty. They are outnumbered but fueled by a grim, disciplined zeal.
*   **The Politiques:** A clandestine network of scholars, lawyers, and disillusioned nobles. They meet in cellar libraries and darkened cloisters, plotting to bring Henri to the throne through a "necessary" conversion to Catholicism—the pragmatic "Paris is worth a Mass" strategy.
*   **The Spanish Intervention:** General Alexander Farnese, the Duke of Parma, maneuvers his invincible infantry across the border from the Spanish Netherlands, a looming shadow that threatens to turn France into a mere province of the Habsburg Empire.

**Narrative Hooks**
*   **The Courier’s Gambit:** A young cartographer is tasked with smuggling a secret correspondence from the moderate Catholics within Paris to Henri’s camp. The message contains the location of a secret passage through the city’s medieval walls, but the courier is hunted by the "Red Capes," the League’s brutal secret police.
*   **The Alchemist of Saint-Cloud:** Amidst the famine in Paris, an alchemist claims to have rediscovered the Greek fire of antiquity. Both the League and the King’s agents race to secure the formula, leading to a shadow war in the city’s catacombs.
*   **The Siege of Rouen:** A disgraced knight seeks redemption by defending a vital supply bridge against a Spanish detachment. The conflict is not just military, but a test of loyalty as his own brother leads the opposing charge.
*   **The Relic Hunt:** Rumors surface that the Sword of Charlemagne, Joyeuse, has been stolen from Saint-Denis. Its recovery would provide the divine legitimacy Henri needs to silence the League’s propaganda.
