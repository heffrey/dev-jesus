# Scene 2

## Capernaum, The Lower Market

Capernaum was a city of grit and salt, a place where the air tasted of dried fish and the sweat of men who lived by the mercy of the tides. Joel spent his morning hauling cedar planks from the docks to the workshop of a man named Eli. The wood was heavy, but the weight felt inconsistent today. Ever since the dream of the shifting grids, Joel found himself testing the world. He would press his thumb into a knot in the wood, expecting it to give way like a soft smudge of ink, but it remained stubbornly, painfully solid. The sun was a physical weight on his shoulders, an unblinking eye that seemed to render the shadows with too much sharpness, as if the world’s contrast had been dialed slightly too high.

Near the town well, a crowd had gathered, though not for water. A man stood in the center of a brewing argument between a tanner and a grain merchant. The tanner was shouting about a debt, his face a map of broken veins and desperation. The man in the center—the one they called Yeshua—wasn't shouting. He stood with a stillness that was almost clinical, his eyes tracking the tanner’s frantic gestures as if mapping the trajectory of the spit flying from his lips. He wore the rough, dusty wool of a laborer, yet he carried himself with the economy of a master craftsman who knew exactly how much force was required to turn a screw and not a fraction more.

"You are demanding a return that exceeds the capacity of the harvest," Yeshua said. His voice was quiet but possessed a strange, resonant clarity that cut through the marketplace din like a whistle through fog. "You believe you are extracting value, but you are merely introducing friction into a system that requires flow to survive. If he fails, the loop breaks for you both. You are optimizing for the moment while ensuring your own eventual starvation." The tanner blinked, his anger momentarily short-circuited by the sheer, cold logic of the statement. It wasn't a plea for mercy; it was an observation of a fundamental flaw in the tanner's strategy.

Joel paused, a plank still balanced on his aching shoulder. He felt a sudden, sharp prickle of recognition—not of the man’s face, but of his *tone*. It was the same quality he had felt in the dream: the sense of someone looking at the world from the outside, seeing the gears and the levers instead of the wood and the stone. Yeshua turned his head then, his gaze locking onto Joel with unsettling precision. He didn't smile, and he didn't offer a blessing. He simply nodded, a brief acknowledgement of a shared data point, before turning back to the stunned merchants. Joel felt a shiver that had nothing to do with the heat; it felt as though, for a split second, he had been seen by someone who knew exactly how he was put together.

## The Operations Floor, Sector 7G

In the Operations Floor of The Company, the atmosphere was one of pressurized silence, broken only by the low-frequency hum of the cooling stacks and the occasional rhythmic click of a haptic interface. Aris leaned back in his cradle, his eyes clouded by the frosted silver of the neural feed. On the primary volumetric display, the Galilee sector was a shimmering mesh of amber light. Most of the nodes were dim, representing the billions of sub-routines and NPC-level consciousnesses that populated the simulation. But one node—the Signal—burned with a steady, controlled white light that seemed to pull the surrounding mesh toward it.

"The throttle is holding at ninety-nine percent," a technician murmured from the adjacent terminal, her fingers dancing across a translucent pane of data. "If we let any more of his core architecture through, the local physics will start to warp. We’ve already seen a point-three percent increase in gravitational consistency around his coordinates. He’s too dense, figuratively speaking. The environment can’t handle his native processing speed without some localized texture-popping."

Aris watched the feed. To the inhabitants of the simulation, it looked like a man talking in a dusty square; to Aris, it was a sequence of corrective code being manually injected into a corrupted social algorithm. The "Jesus" instance was working through the incentives of the population, trying to dampen the feedback loops of greed and systemic harm that had begun to threaten the simulation's stability. It was delicate work, like trying to repair a watch with a sledgehammer while pretending the sledgehammer was just another gear.

"Look at this one," Aris said, pointing to a small icon flickering on the edge of the Signal’s proximity radius. A single entity, labeled *JOEL_0412*, was glowing with a faint, anomalous purple hue. "The Signal just acknowledged him. This Joel shouldn't be seeing the patterns yet. He’s a standard laborer class, no elevated permissions, no legacy traits. Why is his perception-buffer leaking?" 

The technician tapped a few keys, the light of the screen reflecting off her sterile, white visor. "I’ll run a diagnostic, but it might be a side effect of the Signal's presence. When you drop a high-resolution object into a low-resolution environment, the edges tend to bleed. He isn't enlightened, Aris. He’s just starting to notice the grain of the wood. If he looks too closely, he might see the code behind the splinters."
