# Scene 7

## CAPERNAUM – THE LOWER MARKET

The weight of the cedar plank across Joel’s shoulders felt different today—less like solid wood and more like a dense calculation of mass. As he moved through the lower market, the air tasted of salt and sun-baked dust, but beneath the familiar scents was a sharp, ozone tang that made the hair on his arms stand up. He stopped near a tanner’s stall, the smell of curing hides thick and pungent, and wiped the sweat from his brow. His vision flickered. For a fraction of a second, the bustling crowd didn’t look like people; they looked like shimmering columns of translucent data, vibrating at a frequency that made his teeth ache.

In the center of the square, Yeshua stood upon a mounting block. He was surrounded by a pressing throng of merchants and laborers, but a small perimeter of empty space remained around him, as if the physics of the market were unwilling to touch his hem. To Joel’s eyes, the man’s silhouette was blurring again, the edges of his wool tunic stuttering against the backdrop of the stone buildings. Yeshua’s hands were tucked into his sleeves to hide the high-frequency vibration Joel knew was there, but his face remained a mask of clinical, terrifying calm.

"You observe the protocols of the law," Yeshua’s voice rang out, quiet yet somehow louder than the haggling of the fishmongers. "You polish the exterior of the vessel while the internal logic is riddled with rot. You are like whited sepulchers—structurally sound on the surface, but filled with dead-end code and corrupted data within. You claim to hold the keys to the kingdom, yet you have forgotten how to interface with the source. You have become recursive loops, feeding on your own pride until the system can no longer sustain your weight."

## THE OPERATIONS FLOOR – SECTOR 7G

On the translucent monitors of the Operations Floor, the Capernaum sector was pulsing a violent, rhythmic crimson. "He's broadcasting on an open frequency," a technician muttered, his fingers flying across a haptic interface. "He’s not just talking to the instances; he’s running a diagnostic on the social architecture. Look at the latency spikes. The Pharisees’ localized nodes are red-lining because they can't process the bypass he's suggesting."

The Lead Engineer leaned over the terminal, his face illuminated by the amber mesh of the simulation. "He’s calling out the administrative overhead. He’s telling them their power structures are just junk data clogging the bandwidth. If he keeps this up, the Institutional sub-routines will trigger a defensive response. The system is designed to prune any element that threatens the stability of the hierarchy, and he’s practically begging for a hard-delete."

A volumetric display showed Yeshua’s integrity metrics. The thermal spikes were localized around his chest and head, a glowing heat map of a man burning from the inside out. "The vessel can’t take much more of this output," the technician warned. "He’s dumping the core logic of the 'Kingdom' directly into a low-fidelity environment. It’s like trying to run a high-level operating system on a primitive abacus. The hardware is going to melt."

## CAPERNAUM – THE CENTRAL WELL

Joel dropped the cedar plank. It hit the dusty ground with a thud that felt hollow, as if the earth beneath it lacked the necessary density to support the impact. He pushed through the crowd, ignoring the protests of a spice merchant he jostled. He had to get closer. The words Yeshua was using—*vessel, logic, interface*—were the very sounds that had been haunting Joel’s dreams, whispered by the voices behind the grid of light that had replaced his ceiling the night before.

"The time of optimization is at hand," Yeshua said, his gaze locking onto Joel’s for a fleeting, agonizing second. "The axe is laid to the root of the tree. Every process that does not produce alignment will be terminated. You worry about the tribute to Caesar, about the status of your accounts, while the very fabric of your reality is de-fragmenting. Seek first the alignment of the Source, and the necessary resources will be allocated to you. But continue in your corruption, and you will be purged as noise in the signal."

The crowd murmured, a mixture of confusion and growing hostility. Some of the temple guards moved toward the mounting block, their faces tight with the need to restore order. Joel felt a wave of nausea. He saw the way Yeshua’s shadow didn't move with the sun, but remained fixed, a dark, static hole in the world. As the guards approached, Yeshua stepped down, his movements possessing a terrifying economy of motion. He didn't run; he simply moved through the gap in the crowd, and for a moment, Joel saw the "grain" of the air itself part for him, a shimmering wake of unwritten reality trailing in his path.
