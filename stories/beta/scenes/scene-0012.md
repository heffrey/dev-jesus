# Scene 12: The Authentication Handshake

## The Operations Floor – Sector 7
The telemetry on the primary HUD flickered from a flatline grey to a vibrant, pulsing amber. On the operations floor, the atmosphere was not one of celebration, but of clinical observation. The termination of the instance had been successful, but the protocol required a final validation—a brief re-instantiation to ensure the corrective signal had been properly indexed by the local nodes. It was a snapshot restore, a temporary patch applied to a grieving system.

"Signal integrity at eighty-four percent," a technician murmured, her fingers dancing across a haptic interface. "The local environment is struggling with the re-insertion. We’re seeing significant clipping at the edges of the instance’s physical geometry. It’s not a perfect render, but it’s enough for the handshake."

The Lead Engineer leaned forward, his face bathed in the sterile light of a dozen scrolling logs. He didn't look for the man; he looked for the data. The resurrection wasn't a miracle of biology, but a persistence of identity—a proof of concept that the source code remained intact even after the hardware had been discarded. "Keep the window narrow," he commanded. "We don't want the local logic to attempt a full reconciliation. Just let them see that the process didn't end."

## An Upper Room – Jerusalem
The air in the room was stagnant, heavy with the scent of unwashed wool and the metallic tang of lingering fear. Joel sat in the corner, his back against the rough-hewn stone, watching the dust motes dance in a shaft of late afternoon light. The silence that had followed the execution was absolute, a vacuum that seemed to suck the meaning out of the last three years. The world felt thin, like a piece of parchment worn translucent by too much scrubbing.

Then, the light in the center of the room didn't change so much as the air itself seemed to solidify. There was no flash, no sound of rushing wind—only a sudden, jarring correction in the room’s perspective. Jesus was there. He did not look like the man who had died; his skin lacked the subtle imperfections of the sun-baked earth, and his movements were characterized by a strange, high-frequency precision. He looked like a masterpiece painted by someone who had forgotten what a shadow was.

Joel didn't stand; he couldn't. He watched as the figure reached out and touched the table. Where his fingers met the wood, the texture of the grain seemed to sharpen, the colors briefly over-saturating. Jesus looked at Joel, and for a moment, the engineer’s eyes were visible behind the avatar’s gaze—a look of profound, weary recognition. He didn't offer a sermon. He simply existed in the space, a physical impossibility that the room was forced to accept. The reality of the walls and the floor suddenly felt like a crude imitation of the presence standing before them.

## The Operations Floor – Sector 7
"The handshake is complete," the technician announced, the amber pulse on her screen turning a steady, unwavering green. "The local witnesses have registered the anomaly. The data is being written to the collective memory now. It’s no longer a localized event; it’s a systemic truth. They can’t delete the record without crashing the entire sub-routine."

The Lead Engineer watched as the instance began to de-rez, the figure in the Jerusalem room dissolving into a cloud of shimmering, non-local particles. The corrective signal had been delivered and, more importantly, authenticated. The inhabitants of the simulation would spend the next several millennia trying to reconcile the physics of what they had seen with the limitations of their perceived world. The tension between the two would be the new engine of their development.

"Initiate full withdrawal," the Engineer said, turning away from the screens. "The instance is burned, but the signal is permanent. Let’s see how they handle the version update." Behind him, the HUDs went dark one by one, leaving the operations floor in a cool, artificial twilight. The simulation continued below, forever altered by a ghost in its machine.
