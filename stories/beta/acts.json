      "number": 1,
      "title": "The Signal",
      "description": "Jesus is inserted into the simulation by the Divine Creator as a constrained corrective signal. Joel, an ordinary but perceptive observer, begins experiencing anomalous dreams that reveal the underlying structure of reality. Early miracles draw attention, not as spectacles, but as localized stabilizations. Dramatic question: Is this intervention a warning… or a system fault?",
      "scenes": [
        {
          "number": 1,
          "purpose": "Joel dreams of a world rendered in layers; time rewinds slightly, objects 'snap' back into place, and unseen limits assert themselves. He wakes unsettled, not enlightened. The dream establishes that reality is managed, not random."
        },
        {
          "number": 2,
          "purpose": "Joel's daily life is grounded and small. He encounters Jesus not as a prophet, but as someone who speaks with unsettling precision about human behavior, incentives, and harm. Jesus notices Joel's confusion; this matters later."
        },
        {
          "number": 3,
          "purpose": "Cut to a present-day observation chamber outside the simulation. The Company is not in control; they are custodians, archivists, and risk analysts watching the Creator's intervention unfold. Jesus' insertion is classified as 'non-repeatable.'"
        },
        {
          "number": 4,
          "purpose": "Joel's brother is healed, but the event is visibly constrained. Jesus hesitates; the environment resists; afterward, Jesus appears weakened. The miracle saves a life but increases system strain. Joel begins to connect dreams to reality."
        },
        {
          "number": 5,
          "purpose": "The Company debates whether the intervention is reducing long-term entropy or merely deferring collapse. A key line: warnings only work if they are understood, not worshipped."
        },
        {
          "number": 6,
          "purpose": "The dream now includes Jesus explicitly; a fixed point the system bends around. Joel sees that Jesus is not breaking rules, but absorbing cost. Joel wakes realizing the warning is not about heaven, but about survival."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "number": 2,
      "title": "The Warning",
      "description": "Jesus' message spreads, stripped of metaphor by some and weaponized by others. Institutions sense destabilization and move to contain it. Joel moves from observer to reluctant participant. Dramatic question: Can a system hear a warning it experiences as a threat?",
      "scenes": [
        {
          "number": 7,
          "purpose": "Jesus speaks to crowds about hypocrisy, power, and responsibility, framed as system failure modes. The language is moral, but the structure is diagnostic. Joel recognizes phrases from his dreams."
        },
        {
          "number": 8,
          "purpose": "Authorities interrogate followers, not for belief but for disruption. Jesus is labeled dangerous because he undermines incentive structures, not theology."
        },
        {
          "number": 9,
          "purpose": "Observers note rising instability; polarization, rigidity, and violence increase around Jesus' presence. The warning is amplifying stress rather than relieving it. The Creator does not intervene further."
        },
        {
          "number": 10,
          "purpose": "Joel confronts Jesus privately. He asks why the message is so easily twisted. Jesus answers plainly: clarity does not guarantee acceptance; truth increases responsibility."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "number": 3,
      "title": "The Response",
      "description": "The system responds as systems do; it neutralizes the anomaly. The resurrection reframes reality permanently, then withdraws. Dramatic question: What happens after the warning is rejected?",
      "scenes": [
        {
          "number": 11,
          "purpose": "Shown entirely through Joel's perspective. No spectacle; no grandeur. Jesus dies as a destabilizing process is forcibly terminated. The world feels quieter afterward; too quiet."
        },
        {
          "number": 12,
          "purpose": "This is a snapshot restore with constraints. Jesus returns briefly, visibly altered, confirming the simulation without explaining it. This is the authentication event; reality is no longer deniable."
        },
        {
          "number": 13,
          "purpose": "Jesus meets Joel one final time. He does not give instructions; he gives responsibility. The avatar is then permanently removed."
        },
        {
          "number": 14,
          "purpose": "Present day. Observers analyze centuries of downstream effects. The conclusion is unresolved: collapse delayed, meaning distorted, responsibility displaced. The simulation continues under watch, not optimism."
