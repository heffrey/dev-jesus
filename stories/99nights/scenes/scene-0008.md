# Scene 8

## Night 17 | The Hollow-Cairn

The air inside the Sanctuary of Soot did not merely grow cold; it ossified. XPM leaned against the central Hearth-Stone, his lungs burning with the jagged, metallic scrape of Iron Breath. Each inhalation felt like swallowing needles of rime, a byproduct of the extreme localized frost projected by the entity looming at the tree-line. On his salt-crusted collar, Jack was no longer a tattered spirit-form but a frantic, microscopic blue spark, his essence retreating into the smallest possible volume to avoid the heat-drinking vacuum of the forest’s malice. 

Outside the circle of volcanic stone, the Obsidian Weald had fallen into a terrifying, unnatural silence. The rhythmic pulsing of the violet flora had ceased, replaced by the sound of the world becoming brittle. The Great Stillness stood motionless, its bipedal, stag-like silhouette a void against the lesser darkness of the trees. Its red eyes were not burning orves but freezing points of light, fixed with geometric precision on the iron cradle where the Solemn Ember flickered. The volcanic rock beneath XPM’s boots groaned, a deep, tectonic protest as the Architect of Stasis forced the temperature toward an absolute zero that threatened to shatter the very sanctuary.

XPM reached for his staff, his fingers stiff and clumsy within their salt-stained wraps. He could feel the silver-thistle residue on his skin losing its last vestige of warmth, turning into a numb, violet bruise. "Stay low, Jack," he rasped, the words puffing out as a grey cloud of frost that instantly crystallized and fell to the floor as dust. The Tinder-Lad didn't respond with words; he only pulsed a rhythmic, terrified blue light against XPM’s throat, a heartbeat of pure dread.

## Night 18 | The Shattering of the Sacks

The attack was not a physical blow, but a sudden, violent expansion of the cold. The Architect of Stasis stepped forward, and the Hearth-Point’s protective heat didn't just fade—it imploded. XPM lunged for his supply satchel, sensing the entity’s intent, but the frost moved faster. The extreme temperature drop hit the leather bag with the force of a hammer. Inside, the Oyl-Berries—the chemical flares that were their only defense against the deep shadows—crystallized instantly. They did not merely freeze; their volatile internal fluids expanded and shattered their skins, turning the precious fuel into useless, blackened slush that smelled of bitter almonds and death.

A sharp, glass-like crack echoed through the Cairn as the vellum map in XPM’s pocket succumbed to the frost. The ancient parchment, which had guided Wick-Keepers for generations, disintegrated into a thousand unreadable shards of frozen skin. XPM let out a choked sound, a mix of a cough and a groan, as he watched their secondary light sources and their navigation tools perish in a single breath of the Great Stillness. The entity tilted its antlered head, a gesture of cold curiosity, as it watched the travelers’ hope literally crumble into the ash of the hearth.

Jack’s spark flared bright white for a second, a silent scream of spirit-light, as the cold reached for him. XPM threw his heavy, weathered cloak over the iron cradle, shielding the Solemn Ember with his own body. He felt the heat being sucked out of his marrow, his very memories of warmth feeling like currency being spent to keep the fragment of the fallen star alive. The secondary supplies were gone; there were no more flares, no more maps, and no more safety nets. There was only the Ember, and the encroaching, predatory dark.

## Night 18 | The Ash-Choked Silence

As the Great Stillness retreated back into the violet twilight of the Weald, it left behind a sanctuary that was no longer a refuge, but a tomb of cold soot. XPM knelt by the Hearth-Stone, his hands trembling so violently that the salt-crust on his wraps flaked off like dead skin. He reached into the ruins of his satchel, his fingers brushing against the frigid, oily muck that had once been their Oyl-Berries. The loss was absolute. Without the berries, they could not push back the Hollow-Walkers; without the map, they were wandering blind through a forest that rearranged its geometry with every heartbeat.

"Jack?" XPM whispered, his voice a dry rattle. The blue spark on his collar was dim, nearly grey, flickering with a rhythmic instability that suggested the Tinder-Lad’s spirit was fraying at the edges. The youth’s voice finally came through, a thin, wavering echo that sounded like wind through dry grass. "It’s... it’s so quiet, Elara. I can’t hear the iron-bark anymore. I can’t hear anything but the frost." The use of the old name sent a pang through XPM’s chest, a reminder of a life before the mission, now buried under layers of duty and ice.

The Solemn Ember gave a defiant, low-orange pulse from within its iron cradle, the last true light in the Obsidian Weald. It was a meager glow, barely illuminating the jagged cracks that now ran through the volcanic floor of the Cairn. XPM stood up, his joints popping like dry twigs. He took his staff in one hand and the cradle in the other, the weight of the mission now doubled by the absence of their supplies. They had survived the siege of the Gloaming Throat, but they were now ghosts in a living labyrinth, stripped of everything but the fire they were destined to carry to their end.
