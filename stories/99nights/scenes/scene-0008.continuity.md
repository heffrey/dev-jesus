- **Status of Supplies:** All Oyl-Berries (chemical flares) are destroyed (turned to blackened slush); the ancient vellum map has disintegrated into frozen shards.
- **Key Objects:** The iron cradle containing the Solemn Ember (low orange pulse); XPM’s staff; a heavy, weathered cloak; salt-stained wraps.
- **XPM Physical State:** Suffering from "Iron Breath" (exhaling frost dust); fingers numb/stiff; silver-thistle residue has turned into a violet bruise on the skin.
- **Jack Physical/Emotional State:** Spirit-form is "fraying," reduced to a dim, flickering grey-blue spark on XPM's collar; disoriented and fearful.
