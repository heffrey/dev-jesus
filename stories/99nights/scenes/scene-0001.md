# Scene 1

## Night 1: The Threshold of the Obsidian Weald

XPM stood at the ragged lip of the world, where the dying grass gave way to the suffocating density of the Obsidian Weald. His breath came in heavy, metered plumes, a rhythmic testament to a body built for endurance and burdened by a singular, parasitic purpose. The Exiled Precept adjusted the straps of the iron-bound cradle upon his back, feeling the dormant weight of the fallen star fragment. It was cold now, a jagged tooth of absolute void, but it craved the spark he was about to provide.

Beside him, Jack flickered like a candle caught in a draft. The Tinder-Lad’s translucent feet didn't quite displace the ash-heavy soil, but his head tilted with a bird-like twitch, ears straining toward the interior of the Living Labyrinth. To Jack, the forest was not silent; it was a cacophony of groaning iron-bark and the rhythmic, bioluminescent thrum of the violet flora. He clutched his own navigational charms, his spirit-tether humming with a nervous, high-pitched frequency that only XPM seemed to ignore.

The sky above was a bruised expanse of permanent twilight, devoid of the sun’s warmth for longer than the Wick-Keeper cared to remember. Here, at the edge of the Nursery of Briars, the geometry of the trees seemed to lean inward, as if the forest itself were inhaling, preparing to swallow them whole. XPM reached into his heavy tunic, his weathered fingers finding the flint and the catalytic marrow required for the first night’s ignition.

## The Ignition of the Solemn Ember

With a series of methodical strikes, XPM coaxed a spark into the cradle. The reaction was instantaneous and violent. The Solemn Ember caught, blooming from a dull grey stone into a pulsing, amber heart that bled thick, golden light against the encroaching violet gloom. The heat was not comforting; it was a hungry, demanding warmth that seemed to draw the very moisture from XPM’s skin, anchoring his life-force to the light he was sworn to protect. He grunted, his stoic features illuminated in sharp, harsh relief as the pilgrimage officially began.

At the base of the nearest iron-bark tree, the Whisper-Moss began to stir. The pale, vein-like lichen crept toward the light, its tiny cilia vibrating as it recorded the heat of their breath and the cadence of their heartbeats. This was the forest’s ledger, a living record of every soul that dared to tread its path. XPM watched the moss turn a deep, bruised crimson as it drank in their presence, archiving the start of their ninety-nine-night descent into the dark.

"It hears us, Wick-Keeper," Jack whispered, his voice an echo of a sound that had already passed. The youth’s eyes were wide, reflecting the dancing flames of the Ember. "The moss is singing our names to the roots. It’s telling the deep places that the heat has returned." XPM did not respond with words, only a sharp nod. He took the first step forward, his heavy boots crushing the recording moss, silencing its vibration beneath his weight.

## Into the Nursery of Briars

As they crossed the threshold, the Obsidian Weald shifted. The trees did not move, yet the path behind them simply ceased to be, replaced by a wall of interlocking thorns and fractured space. The air grew thick with the scent of ozone and ancient sap. XPM moved with a deliberate, rhythmic gait, the light of the Solemn Ember carving a sphere of reality out of the shifting illusions of the Weald. He was the anchor, and Jack was the kite, the boy darting ahead to press his ear against the cold trunks of the iron-bark to discern the safest route through the Nursery.

The forest pulsed. It was a low, subterranean thud that vibrated through XPM’s marrow, timed perfectly to the flickering of the star-fragment. In this place, memories were not mere thoughts; they were the currency of survival, and XPM could feel the Weald reaching into the peripheries of his mind, testing the strength of his resolve. He tightened his grip on his staff, his eyes fixed forward, refusing to look into the violet shadows where the trees seemed to take the shape of forgotten faces.

Far off, beyond the reach of the amber glow, a different kind of silence manifested. It was a cold, predatory stillness that moved with a bipedal grace, heavy and ancient. Jack froze, his spirit-form turning a pale, terrified blue as he looked toward the deeper thickets. The Great Stillness was aware of them. The Architect of Stasis had felt the first crackle of the Ember, and the long hunt had begun. XPM did not slow his pace; the Altar of the First Dawn was a distant promise, and they had ninety-eight nights left to survive.
