# Scene 4

## Night 14: The Marrow-Groves, Obsidian Weald

The violet twilight of the Obsidian Weald had grown thick, coagulating like bruised fruit around the gnarled roots of the Marrow-Groves. XPM moved with a heavy, rhythmic gait, his boots crunching through a carpet of calcified leaves that shattered like glass. The Solemn Ember, nestled within its iron-bound cradle against his chest, cast a rhythmic amber pulse that fought against the encroaching gloom. His leather hand wraps were stiff with dried salt and the residue of the Silver-Thistle, and every joint in his weathered frame protested the humid chill that had settled over the forest since their escape from the Great Stillness.

Jack hovered a few paces ahead, his cerulean spirit-form flickering like a dying candle. The youth’s translucent fingers danced along the bark of a massive, weeping iron-bark tree, his head tilted as he listened to the subsonic vibrations of the wood. "The echoes are wrong here, Wick-Keeper," Jack whispered, his voice a shimmering vibration that barely disturbed the air. "The trees aren't singing; they’re holding their breath. Something died here a long time ago, and the forest hasn't forgotten the taste of it."

XPM didn't respond immediately, his focus narrowed to the steady rise and fall of his own chest—a discipline of breath he had maintained since the encounter in the Frost-Lace Hollows. He stopped before a hollowed-out stump that bled a viscous, bioluminescent sap. Tucked deep within the cavity, protected from the predatory dampness of the Weald, was a bundle of oil-cloth and bone. He reached in, his calloused fingers brushing against the cold remains of a predecessor who had failed the pilgrimage long before his own 99-night vigil had begun.

## The Hollow of the Predecessor

With a grunt of exertion, XPM pulled the bundle into the amber glow of the Ember. The cloth unraveled to reveal a tattered journal, its leather cover cured in wood-ash and stained with the dark, iron-scented ghost of old blood. As he opened the brittle pages, the scent of stale smoke and ancient soot filled the air—a phantom smell of a long-dead hearth. Jack drifted closer, his icy blue light mingling with the orange radiance of the cradle, his jittery energy momentarily stilled by the weight of the discovery.

The journal was a frantic record of failure and cartography. Scrawled in charcoal and crushed berry juice were sketches of the Nursery of Briars, detailing the shifting geometry of the forest’s "braiding" paths. XPM traced a line with a trembling thumb; the previous Wick-Keeper had mapped the specific rhythm of the Weald’s heartbeat, noting how the flora pulsed in synchronicity with the traveler's own pulse to track them. It was more than a diary; it was a survival manual written in the ink of desperation.

"He found it," Jack murmured, his spirit-form vibrating with a sudden, sharp clarity. "Look at the margins, Elara. He didn't just see the path; he heard the Altar. He wrote down the frequency of the First Dawn." Jack’s hand passed through the page, a ripple of static-like frost trailing in his wake. "The path into the deeper woods isn't a physical trail—it's a gap in the Great Stillness's attention. A blind spot in the Architect's eye."

## The Map of Veins

XPM turned to the final page, where a fold-out map of translucent vellum depicted the Obsidian Weald not as a forest, but as a circulatory system. The veins represented the ley-lines of heat that still lingered in the soil, leading toward a central point labeled the Altar of the First Dawn. The map provided the missing sequence: a series of "Hearth-Points" or Hollow-Cairns that could serve as temporary sanctuaries. It was the final clue needed to pierce the Nursery of Briars and move toward the heart of the labyrinth.

"We have the heading," XPM said, his voice raspy from days of silence and dehydration. He carefully tucked the journal into his pack, alongside the vibrating Silver-Thistle and Oyl-Berries. He looked up into the violet canopy, where the shadows seemed to lean inward, hungry for the warmth radiating from his chest. The Great Stillness was out there, a bipedal shadow waiting for them to falter, but for the first time since the pilgrimage began, the darkness felt navigable.

Jack flickered brightly, his icy blue hue sharpening into a determined spark. "I can hear the route now. It sounds like... like a low hum beneath the frost." He pointed toward a dense thicket of obsidian thorns that looked impassable to the naked eye. "Through the Briars, Wick-Keeper. If we move now, we can reach the next Sanctuary of Soot before the forest exhales again." XPM nodded, adjusted the iron-bound cradle, and stepped back into the rhythmic toil of his mission, the Solemn Ember burning a defiant orange against the eternal night.
