# Scene 7

## Night 17, The Hollow-Cairn: Sanctuary of Soot

The air thickens with the scent of ancient combustion as XPM crests the final basalt rise. The Sanctuary of Soot, a jagged tooth of volcanic rock jutting from the throat of the Obsidian Weald, offers a brutal, wind-scoured reprieve. XPM’s movements are agonizingly slow; his salt-crusted leather wraps rasp against the iron-bound cradle of the Solemn Ember with every rhythmic step. The silver-thistle residue on his hands has faded to a sickly, bruised violet, no longer providing the warmth necessary to stave off the Iron Breath that rattles through his lungs.

With a grunt of exertion, XPM lowers the cradle into the central depression of the Hearth-Stone. As the iron frame meets the volcanic rock, a low, tectonic hum vibrates through the ground. The Solemn Ember, sensing the sanctuary, pulses with a sudden, desperate vitality. An orange glow bleeds into the surrounding soot, pushing back the violet twilight of the Weald. XPM collapses against the stone, his breath coming in ragged plumes of steam as the heat begins to thaw the rime of frost clinging to his heavy brow.

Jack drifts near the ceiling of the cairn, his spirit-form a tattered, translucent gray that flickers like a dying candle. The Echo-Reader’s eyes are wide, fixed on the darkness beyond the sanctuary’s threshold. He no longer speaks in sentences, only fragments of sound—the crackle of freezing sap, the grinding of iron-bark. "They are gathering, Elara," he whispers, his voice a thin vibration in the air. "The heat... it’s a dinner bell. The Stillness is folding the trees; they’re coming to drink the light."

## The Siege of the Gloaming Throat: The First Wave

The transition is instantaneous. The rhythmic pulse of the forest, which had been a distant thrum, surges into a deafening roar of snapping timber. From the obsidian shadows beyond the firelight, the Predatory Shadows emerge—viscous, ink-black shapes that move with the jerky, unnatural gait of puppets. They do not have faces, only voids that seem to pull at the very heat radiating from the Hearth-Stone. They are the frontline of the Great Stillness, the foot soldiers of a cold that desires only the cessation of all motion.

XPM rises, his staff held in a white-knuckled grip. He reaches into his pouch, crushing a handful of Oyl-Berries against the iron bars of the cradle. The berries burst with a pungent, chemical hiss, sending a flare of artificial heat and blinding white light into the encroaching gloom. The shadows shriek—a sound like metal shearing—and recoil, their forms evaporating into greasy smoke. But for every shadow that dissipates, three more emerge from the shifting geometry of the iron-bark trees, drawn by the irresistible lure of the Ember.

Jack screams, his form dimming as he dives toward XPM’s shoulder. "Left! The roots are walking!" A massive, knotted limb of iron-bark, animated by the forest’s malicious intent, smashes into the side of the cairn, showering the interior with sparks and stone dust. XPM swings his staff, the silver-thistle residue igniting briefly as it connects with a shadow-form attempting to scale the Hearth-Stone. The Wick-Keeper’s movements are heavy, driven by a primal, weary duty, but the sheer volume of the assault is beginning to fray his iron resolve.

## The Architect’s Shadow: The Standoff

At the edge of the clearing, where the orange light of the Ember meets the suffocating dark of the Weald, the Great Stillness manifests. It does not join the frantic assault of the shadows. Instead, the Bipedal Terror stands motionless, its stag-like head crowned with antlers of frozen bone. Its red eyes, twin coals of ancient, predatory intelligence, lock onto XPM. The temperature within the Sanctuary of Soot plummets. The volcanic stone, once warm to the touch, begins to crack under a sudden, localized frost. 

"It’s him," Jack whimpers, his spirit-form shrinking until he is little more than a blue spark clinging to XPM’s collar. "The Architect. He’s not here to fight, Elara. He’s here to watch us freeze." The Great Stillness raises a cloven hand, and the Predatory Shadows redouble their efforts, flinging themselves into the light with suicidal fervor. They are not trying to kill XPM; they are trying to smother the Ember with the sheer mass of their cold, dead essence.

XPM stands over the Hearth-Stone, his body a shield against the encroaching dark. He is a man of the old world, a keeper of a flame that is increasingly irrelevant in a forest that has forgotten the sun. He feels the Iron Breath settling in his joints, the metallic taste of failure rising in his throat. Yet, as the Architect of Stasis watches from the tree-line, XPM adjusts his grip and prepares for the long, violent night ahead. The siege has only just begun, and the Gloaming Throat demands a price in heat that they can ill afford to pay.
