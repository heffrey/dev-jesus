# Pancake

## Story Concept

The backyard was draped in the heavy, humid gloom of a Tuesday afternoon. Galia had insisted on a dress code: "Breakfast Formal." She stood at the head of a freshly dug trench, her face obscured by a veil fashioned from a delicate, lace-edged cloth napkin. In her trembling hands, she held a grease-stained index card.

The deceased, a six-inch buttermilk pancake named Sir Pokes-a-Lot, rested within a velvet-lined mahogany cigar box. He was a majestic specimen, though his edges had begun to curl with the cruel onset of rigor mortis—or perhaps just staleness. One of his chocolate-chip eyes had migrated slightly toward his "chin" during the Great Scrapping, the traumatic event where Galia’s unfeeling brother, Jeff, had swept him off the bedside table and into the cold, dark void of the Glad heavy-duty trash bag.

The mourners were few but fervent. There was Barnaby, a stuffed rabbit with one ear missing, and a half-empty bottle of Grade A Amber maple syrup that sat precariously on a folding chair, its cap sticky with what looked like amber tears.

Galia cleared her throat, the sound catching on a sob. 

"We are gathered here today," she began, her voice fluttering like a spatula in a hot pan, "to honor a hero who was taken from us before his syrup could truly soak in. Sir Pokes-a-Lot didn't ask to be born in a non-stick skillet. He didn't ask for the blueberries that gave him his signature, brooding aesthetic. He was simply... there. A constant, golden-brown presence in a world of burnt toast."

She looked down at the cigar box, her eyes welling. "Some called him 'old food.' Some called him 'a health hazard.' Jeff called him 'the reason we have ants.' But I called him a confidant. He listened to my problems for three days straight without once mentioning his own shelf life. He was a silent listener, a spongy shoulder to cry on, and the only character in this house who didn't judge me for binge-watching period dramas at 3:00 AM."

Galia reached into her pocket and pulled out a single, shimmering butter pat. She placed it gently on Sir Pokes-a-Lot’s chest, a final offering for the journey to the Great Griddle in the Sky. 

"You were too fluffy for this world, Pokes," she whispered. "May your flip always be clean, and may you never know the sting of a garbage disposal again."

As she signaled for the Bluetooth speaker to play a somber, violin-heavy rendition of "Shortnin' Bread," a gust of wind caught the lace napkin veil, blowing it into her mouth. She choked briefly, a moment of slapstick grief that only underscored the absurdity of her loss. She began to lower the cigar box into the earth, the scent of damp soil mixing with the faint, lingering aroma of vanilla extract and betrayal.

## Structure

This story is structured using Borges' Four Cycles framework:

- **The Troy Cycle**: War, destruction, and rebuilding. Conflict, siege, and fall. The cycle of conflict and its aftermath.
- **The Search Cycle**: Quest, journey, and discovery. The pursuit of something lost or desired. The cycle of seeking.
- **The Return Cycle**: Homecoming, recognition, and restoration. Coming back to where one began. The cycle of return.
