# Scene 12

## Tuesday, 3:15 PM – The Garden of Gluten (The Backyard)

The final notes of "Shortnin' Bread" wheezed out of the Bluetooth speaker, leaving a vacuum of silence that felt heavier than the humid afternoon air. Galia remained on her knees by the trench, her fingers still stained with the espresso "ashes" she had scattered over the mahogany cigar box. The lace napkin veil, now draped haphazardly around her neck like a discarded cravat, fluttered in the breeze. She stared at the headless neon-green dinosaur standing guard over Sir Pokes-a-Lot’s final resting place, her chest heaving with the rhythmic leftovers of a sob.

Amelia, sensing the shift in the ritual's energy, crawled toward the moat of syrup. Her blonde hair was a chaotic nest of static and dried maple leaves, and a singular smudge of espresso dirt decorated her cheek like a war paint stripe. She reached out a chubby finger, testing the viscosity of the Grade A Amber. "Sticky," she proclaimed, her blue eyes wide with the discovery. She then looked at the grave and patted the damp earth with a wet slap. "Bye-bye, cake."

Mom stepped forward, the hem of her damp floral apron brushing against the wilting weeds. She reached down, her hand—smelling of dish soap and the faint, powdery scent of old roses—resting on Galia’s shoulder. The sun struggled to pierce through the gloom, reflecting off Mom’s fogged glasses. "He’s in a better place now, Galia," she said, her voice a steady, low hum. "In the Great Griddle, there are no trash bags. There is no Jeff. There is only the infinite warmth of a preheated burner."

## Tuesday, 3:30 PM – The Birthplace (The Kitchen)

The trio retreated from the backyard, leaving the Garden of Gluten to the worms and the ants that Jeff had so feared. As they crossed the threshold into the kitchen, the air changed from the scent of damp earth to the familiar, scrubbed clinicality of suburban life. The linoleum felt cold under Galia’s feet, a stark reminder of the hard surfaces that had once claimed Sir Pokes-a-Lot. She moved to the sink, watching the dark espresso grounds swirl down the drain as she washed her hands, feeling a phantom weight where the cocktail fork had been.

Mom began to unpeel Amelia’s sticky socks, tossing them toward the laundry room with practiced ease. "It’s a tragedy, truly," Mom remarked, her tone shifting into that specific gear of morbid optimism that always made Galia feel both comforted and slightly horrified. "But you have to look on the bright side, dear. At least he wasn't used as a makeshift coaster for a condensation-heavy beer can before being folded in half and fed to a stray dog with rabies. That would have been undignified."

Galia dried her hands on a tea towel, her eyes drifting to the empty non-stick skillet sitting on the stove. The "Chrome Abyss" of the trashcan sat in the corner, its lid shut tight, a silent metallic tomb for Jeff’s sins. "I just keep thinking about the blueberries," Galia whispered, her voice regaining its strength. "They were so perfectly placed. He had such a brooding, soulful gaze."

## Tuesday, 3:45 PM – The Laboratory of Leavening (The Kitchen)

Amelia sat on the counter, swinging her legs and humming a fragmented version of the funeral dirge while Mom wiped her face with a damp cloth. The kitchen, once the site of the Great Scrapping, began to feel like a sanctuary again. The light of the late afternoon hit the flour canister, turning the dust motes in the air into shimmering grains of gold. The grief hadn't vanished, but it had settled into the floorboards, becoming part of the house’s quiet history.

Mom reached into the pantry, pulling out a fresh bag of buttermilk mix and the vanilla extract. She set them on the counter with a definitive *thump*. "Nature abhors a vacuum, Galia, and so does an empty stomach," she said, her eyes twinkling with a stoic kind of kindness. "Sir Pokes-a-Lot lived a full, three-day life on a bedside table. Most breakfast foods don't survive the first twenty minutes of a Tuesday. He was a king among cakes."

Galia looked at the ingredients, then at the pink spatula resting by the sink. She felt the heavy mantle of the High Priestess of Hotcakes begin to lift, replaced by a simple, grounding hunger. She reached for the mixing bowl, her movements fluid and purposeful. "He would want us to carry on," Galia said, her voice finally steady. "He wouldn't want the griddle to go cold on his account." As she cracked the first egg, the sound of the shell snapping marked the end of the mourning and the beginning of the batter. The cycle was restored.
