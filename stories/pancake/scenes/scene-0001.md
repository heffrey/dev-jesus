# Scene 1

## Time: Tuesday Morning / Location: The Kitchen (The Laboratory of Leavening)

The morning sun sliced through the blinds of the kitchen, illuminating the fine dust motes that danced over the laminate countertops. Galia entered the room with the quiet reverence of a monk approaching an altar, her eyes immediately darting to the mahogany bedside-table-turned-pedestal she had set up near the toaster. It was empty. The space where Sir Pokes-a-Lot had presided for the last seventy-two hours—resting on a doily of paper towels—was now a barren stretch of faux-marble, save for a single, mocking smear of congealed butter.

A low, guttural sound escaped Galia’s throat, a noise that sat somewhere between a wounded animal and a boiling kettle. She began to circle the kitchen island, her hands trembling as she checked behind the fruit bowl and underneath the stack of unsorted mail. Sir Pokes-a-Lot was not merely a breakfast item; he was a triumph of leavening, a six-inch buttermilk marvel whose chocolate-chip eyes had witnessed her deepest vulnerabilities. To move him was a sacrilege; to remove him was an act of war.

"Jeff?" Galia’s voice cracked, vibrating through the silent house. There was no answer from her brother’s room, only the distant, rhythmic hum of the dishwasher. She felt a cold dread pooling in her stomach, a sensation far heavier than the half-digested waffle she’d consumed earlier that morning. She turned toward the corner of the room, her gaze landing on the stainless steel cylinder that stood like a silent sentinel of erasure.

## Time: Minutes later / Location: The Trashcan (The Chrome Abyss)

Galia approached the trashcan with leaden steps. Her foot found the pedal, and the lid swung open with a hydraulic hiss that sounded like a final breath. There, resting atop a discarded egg carton and a pile of damp coffee grounds, was the fallen king. Sir Pokes-a-Lot lay facedown in the darkness, his majestic golden-brown edges beginning to curl in the indignity of the refuse. One of his chocolate-chip eyes had been jolted loose during the descent, staring back at her with a look of profound betrayal from the depths of a Glad heavy-duty bag.

"Oh, you poor, sweet prince," Galia whispered, her knees hitting the linoleum. She didn't reach in—not yet—as the shock of the sight required a moment of silent contemplation. The "Great Scrapping" had clearly been swift and clinical. Jeff had seen a "health hazard," but Galia saw a confidant who had listened to her recount the plot of a three-season period drama without once pointing out his own impending expiration date.

The sound of soft, padded footsteps announced the arrival of Amelia. The sixteen-month-old toddler toddled into the kitchen, her blonde curls a halo of static electricity. She clutched a headless plastic dinosaur and peered into the trashcan alongside her aunt. Amelia’s blue eyes widened as she pointed a chubby finger at the discarded pancake. "Uh-oh," she proclaimed, her voice ringing with the unintended gravity of a Greek chorus. "Cake... ouchie?"

## Time: Mid-morning / Location: The Living Room (The Nook of Starch)

Galia had retreated to the living room, cradling the rescued cigar box that would soon become Sir Pokes-a-Lot’s sarcophagus. She sat on the sofa, her face a mask of tragedy, when Mom entered from the hallway. Mom, the seventy-year-old matriarch of the household, took in the scene with a practiced air of stoicism. She adjusted her glasses, looking from the weeping Galia to the pancake-laden box, and then back again. 

"I heard the lid hit the wall," Mom said, her voice steady and calm. She sat down next to Galia, patting her hand with a dry, papery palm. "It’s a tragedy, Galia. Truly. But you have to maintain some perspective, dear. It's a heavy blow, certainly, but at least it wasn't a localized outbreak of the bubonic plague. Imagine if you’d opened that lid and found a nest of infected rats instead of a chocolate-chip pancake. You’d be at the CDC right now, getting poked with very long needles in very sensitive places."

Galia looked up, a single tear tracking through her foundation. "But Mom, Jeff just... he threw him away like he was garbage. He didn't even say goodbye."

Mom nodded slowly, her expression one of morbid optimism. "He’s a man of little sentiment, that Jeff. But look on the bright side: at least he didn't accidentally throw your grandmother's hip replacement into the furnace while she was still using it. That would have been a much louder afternoon. Now, stop your sniffing. We have a cigar box, some lace, and a backyard that’s dying for a bit of ceremony. If we’re going to do this, we’re going to do it with the dignity befitting a buttermilk-based entity."
