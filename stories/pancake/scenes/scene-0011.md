# Scene 11

## Tuesday, 2:05 PM – 2:20 PM; The Garden of Gluten

The humid air clung to the backyard like a damp wool blanket, carrying the heavy, cloying scent of Grade A Amber maple syrup and freshly turned earth. Galia knelt at the edge of the trench, her vanilla-scented sweater damp with perspiration and her lace-edged napkin veil fluttering against her lips with every shaky breath. She looked down into the mahogany cigar box, where Sir Pokes-a-Lot lay enshrined in his bed of espresso grounds. The single chocolate-chip eye seemed to stare back at her, a silent witness to the indignity of the Glad heavy-duty trash bag and the ultimate betrayal of the kitchen counter.

With a hand still stained dark from the espresso "ashes," Galia reached into the pocket of her cardigan. She withdrew a single, cold pat of butter, wrapped in a shimmering foil that caught the dull, grey light of the Tuesday afternoon. It was the highest honor she could bestow—a final, fatty anointing for the journey ahead. She unwrapped it with the precision of a surgeon and placed it squarely in the center of the pancake’s chest. It sat there, a pale yellow monument to the fluffiness that once was, before the cruelty of Jeff and the passage of time had set in.

"You were a good breakfast, Pokes," Galia whispered, her voice cracking under the weight of the absurdity. "You were the gold standard in a world of silver dollars." She took the pink spatula, which lay nearby like a discarded scepter, and began to nudge the first mounds of damp clay over the velvet-lined box. The sound of the soil hitting the mahogany was a dull, final thud that echoed against the rhythmic rattling of the nearby air conditioning unit. As the "Shortnin' Bread" violin solo reached a frantic, mournful crescendo on the Bluetooth speaker, Galia felt a strange sense of equilibrium returning to the Garden of Gluten.

## Tuesday, 2:21 PM – 2:35 PM; The Garden of Gluten

Amelia stood at the foot of the grave, her blonde hair a chaotic halo of static and dried leaves. She watched the burial with the intense, unblinking focus of a creature who had just discovered the concept of "away." To her, the ceremony was a fascinating hybrid of a sandbox session and a snack-time tragedy. She clutched the headless plastic dinosaur—the neon-green guardian of the site—and looked from the deepening hole to her aunt’s tear-streaked face. The gravity of the moment seemed to register in her small, developing world, filtered through the lens of sensory input and the smell of vanilla extract.

As Galia smoothed the final heap of dirt over the cigar box, Amelia stepped forward. She didn't drop a flower or a handful of dust; instead, she reached out and patted the headless dinosaur on its jagged neck. "Bye-bye pan-pan," she chirped, her voice high and clear against the backdrop of the suburban gloom. It was a simple proclamation, stripped of the flowery prose and the existential weight Galia had carried all afternoon. To Amelia, the pancake was simply gone, returned to the earth from whence the flour came.

The toddler then leaned over and planted a sticky, syrup-scented kiss on the air above the grave. "Pan-pan go nap," she added, nodding firmly as if she were the one who had finally settled the matter. The sheer innocence of the gesture broke the tension in the backyard. Galia’s shoulders dropped, and a sob finally escaped her—not of pure grief, but of the exhausted relief that comes when a child provides the closure an adult cannot find. Even the headless dinosaur seemed to stand a little taller in the damp soil, guarding the secrets of the buttermilk soul beneath it.

## Tuesday, 2:36 PM – 2:50 PM; The Garden of Gluten

Mom stood a few feet back, her floral apron damp and her glasses perpetually fogged by the humidity and her own rhythmic breathing. She had watched the proceedings with a stoic, clinical interest, her hands folded over her middle as if bracing for a moderate gust of wind. As Galia stood up, wiping her espresso-stained fingers on her jeans, Mom stepped forward to offer the only kind of comfort she knew how to dispense: the comparative kind. She looked down at the small mound of earth, the pink spatula, and the headless green dinosaur with a look of profound, dark satisfaction.

"Well, Galia," Mom said, her voice dry and steady, "it’s a lovely service. Truly. And you should feel lucky, really. At least he didn't end up in the disposal. My cousin Arthur had a heart attack in a Denny’s, and they didn't even stop the jukebox while the paramedics wheeled him out past the grand slams. At least Sir Pokes-a-Lot had music and a proper box. It could have been much more impersonal." She reached out and patted Galia’s arm with a hand that smelled faintly of dish soap and old roses.

Galia looked at her mother, the lace napkin veil finally slipping from her head to hang limply around her neck like a discarded shroud. She realized then that the absurdity was the point; the funeral was the only way to process a Tuesday that had felt too long and a kitchen that had felt too cold. Together, the three generations of women turned away from the Garden of Gluten, leaving the syrup moat and the mahogany box behind. As they walked toward the back door of the house, the smell of damp clay and vanilla extract lingered in their wake—a final, fading ghost of the breakfast that was, but would never be again.
