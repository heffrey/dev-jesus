# Scene 4

## 11:15 AM - The Nook of Starch (The Living Room)

Galia sat cross-legged on the Berber carpet of the living room, the mahogany cigar box resting in her lap like a holy reliquary. Her vanilla-scented sweater, once a symbol of cozy morning indulgence, now felt like the heavy vestments of a grieving widow. With the steady hand of a surgeon, she used a silver-plated cocktail fork to nudge Sir Pokes-a-Lot’s migrating chocolate-chip eye back toward its original latitude. The pancake looked weary; the ordeal in the trashcan had left him dusted with a fine powder of espresso grounds, giving him the appearance of a soldier who had crawled through the trenches of a caffeine-fueled war. 

Amelia waddled in circles around them, her blonde curls bouncing with a chaotic energy that felt almost sacrilegious. She brandished her headless plastic dinosaur, occasionally poking the velvet lining of the cigar box with its jagged neck. "Cake? Dust?" she chirped, her blue eyes wide as she observed her aunt’s intense focus. She reached out a sticky hand to touch the pancake’s curling edge, but Galia gently intercepted her. "Not now, my tiny acolyte," Galia whispered, her voice thick with emotion. "He is preparing for his final flip. He needs his rest."

Mom stood in the doorway, her arms folded across her chest and her floral apron stained with the mundane residues of a Tuesday that had stayed stubbornly normal for everyone else. She watched the scene with the detached, stoic curiosity of a woman who had survived multiple recessions, several natural disasters, and the 1980s. To her, the living room had become a makeshift wake room, a sanctuary for gluten that should have been digested hours ago. She saw the way Galia cradled the cigar box and knew that there was no returning to the "Silver Purgatory" of the trashcan for Sir Pokes-a-Lot.

## 11:35 AM - The Laboratory of Leavening (The Kitchen)

"He needs the earth, Mom," Galia declared, rising from the floor with the box held firmly at chest level. "He was born of the pan, but he belongs to the garden. I won't have him ending up in a landfill, sandwiched between a chicken carcass and a pile of junk mail. He’s a martyr of the breakfast table." She marched into the kitchen, her eyes searching the drawers for the proper ceremonial accouterments. She settled on a delicate, lace-edged cloth napkin, which she began to fold into a makeshift veil, and a grease-stained index card she had pulled from the recipe box to serve as a script for her sorrow.

Mom sighed, the sound like the slow hiss of a cooling radiator. She followed them into the kitchen, watching as Galia draped the lace over her head. "It’s a lovely sentiment, Galia, really," Mom said, her voice dropping into that familiar, unsettling register of darkly optimistic comfort. "I suppose it’s a very clean way to go. At least he wasn't a medieval peasant who died of ergot poisoning from a bad batch of rye, hallucinating that his family were all giant ravens while his limbs turned black and fell off in the street. Now that would be a messy way to exit this world. A cigar box is practically a palace by comparison."

Galia paused, the lace veil fluttering against her lips. She took a deep breath, absorbing the grim perspective of her mother, and used it to fortify her resolve. "Thank you, Mom. That is... strangely helpful." She turned to Amelia, who was now trying to climb the leg of the kitchen table. "Amelia, fetch your dinosaur. You shall be the flower girl. We are going to the Garden of Gluten." With a somber nod, the procession began to move toward the back door, leaving the smell of vanilla and the weight of betrayal behind in the kitchen.
