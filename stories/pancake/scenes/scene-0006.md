# Scene 6

## 11:40 AM - The Garden of Gluten

The procession came to a halt at the edge of the freshly dug trench. Galia knelt by the mound of damp earth, her vanilla-scented sweater catching on a stray bramble from a nearby wilting hydrangea. She held the mahogany cigar box with the reverence of a priestess handling a reliquary. Beside her, Amelia, the Tiny Acolyte, hummed a tuneless song, her blonde hair catching the dim afternoon light as she swung her headless plastic dinosaur by its tail. 

"We must offer him one final look at the sky," Galia whispered, her voice thick with the humidity of the backyard. "Before the darkness of the loam claims him." She reached for the latch of the box, her fingers trembling. The lid creaked open, revealing Sir Pokes-a-Lot resting on his crimson velvet bed, his surface still lightly dusted with the espresso grounds that Galia had applied as a ceremonial "soil to soil" metaphor. The single remaining chocolate-chip eye stared upward, a dark, cocoa-rich orb of silent judgment.

Sensing a change in the ritual’s energy, Amelia leaned in, her blue eyes widening. To the toddler, the "Great Griddle in the Sky" was a secondary concern compared to the immediate, sensory reality of a chocolate chip. Before Galia could utter the first line of the final benediction, Amelia’s sticky hand darted forward with the speed of a striking cobra. With a wet *plop*, the chocolate chip was gone, plucked cleanly from the pancake’s "face" and vanished into the labyrinth of Amelia’s small, clenched fist.

## 11:45 AM - The Tactical Recovery

Galia let out a sound that was half-gasp, half-sob. "The eye!" she wailed, clutching the now-blinded Sir Pokes-a-Lot to her chest. "She’s taken his vision! He’ll never find his way to the Great Griddle in the dark!" She turned to Amelia, who was currently attempting to shove her chocolate-laden fist into the neck cavity of her headless dinosaur. The girl’s face was a mask of toddler defiance, her cheeks bulging with the secret of the stolen ocular organ.

Mom, standing as a stoic witness in her stained floral apron, didn't move from her position near the humming air conditioning unit. She adjusted her glasses and looked down at the unfolding chaos with a practiced, morbid calm. "At least she didn't choke on it, Galia," Mom offered, her voice a low drone that competed with the AC. "Your cousin Brenda once swallowed a marble and we had to wait three days for it to reappear in a Tupperware container. This is just a bit of semi-sweet cocoa. At least the pancake didn't have glass eyes."

Galia ignored the dark comfort, focusing instead on the frantic negotiation required for a recovery. She dropped to her knees in the dirt, the silver-plated cocktail fork forgotten in the grass. "Amelia, honey, Auntie Galia needs that," she pleaded, her voice fluttering. "That isn't a snack. That is the window to Sir Pokes-a-Lot’s soul. Please, don't make him cross the threshold as a cyclops."

## 11:52 AM - The Restoration of Vision

The search was delicate but desperate. Galia gently pried open Amelia’s fingers, discovering a smear of brown paste and several blades of grass, but no solid chip. The toddler let out a high-pitched giggle, navigating the sensory input of Galia’s frantic tickling as a game rather than a forensic investigation. Finally, Galia spotted a glimmer of dark brown wedged inside the hollow neck of the plastic dinosaur. With the precision of a surgeon, she used the tines of the cocktail fork to extract the mangled remains of the chocolate chip.

It was no longer the proud, pointed morsel it had once been. It was rounded, softened by the heat of a toddler’s palm and the indignity of being stuffed into a toy. Yet, to Galia, it was a holy relic. She carefully pressed the softened chip back onto the pancake’s surface, right above the "chin" where the other eye had migrated during the Great Scrapping. Sir Pokes-a-Lot now looked less like a majestic hero and more like a casualty of a very specific, sugary war, but his dignity—in Galia’s eyes—was restored.

"There," Galia whispered, smoothing the paper towel lining of the cigar box with a shaking hand. "You are whole again, Pokes." She looked up at Mom, who was watching a squirrel navigate the fence with more interest than the funeral. Amelia, bored of the drama, had begun to use her headless dinosaur to dig a secondary, much smaller hole in the Garden of Gluten. The scent of damp soil and vanilla extract hung heavy in the air, a final, fragrant veil before the first shovelful of earth descended.
