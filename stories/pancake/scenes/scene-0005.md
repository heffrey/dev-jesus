# Scene 5

## 10:45 AM: The Nook of Starch (The Living Room)

Galia moved through the living room with the frantic, calculated grace of a museum curator during a flood. Her eyes, red-rimmed and sharp, scanned the shelves of the Nook of Starch, rejecting vessel after vessel. A plastic Tupperware container was deemed "too clinical, too Tupperware," while an old teapot was dismissed for its "claustrophobic spout." She needed something that spoke of dignity, a container that could withstand the damp soil of the Garden of Gluten without compromising the integrity of the deceased.

Behind her, Amelia navigated the carpeted terrain with the erratic gait of a drunken sailor. The toddler clutched her headless plastic dinosaur, occasionally using its jagged neck to poke at a rogue dust mote dancing in a shaft of Tuesday morning light. "Cake!" Amelia barked suddenly, pointing a sticky finger at the coffee table. Galia didn't look back; she was too busy kneeling before a glass-fronted cabinet, her fingers trembling as she reached for a heavy, mahogany cigar box that once belonged to a grandfather who had never understood the sanctity of a well-balanced batter.

With a click that sounded like a gunshot in the quiet room, Galia unlatched the box. The scent of cedar and old, expensive smoke wafted out, a masculine perfume that felt strangely appropriate for a warrior like Sir Pokes-a-Lot. She ran her thumb over the velvet lining—a deep, bruised crimson. It was perfect. It was a sarcophagus fit for a king, or at least for a six-inch buttermilk disc with a wandering chocolate-chip eye. 

## 11:15 AM: The Birthplace (The Kitchen)

Galia returned to the kitchen, the cigar box held aloft like a holy relic. Mom stood by the counter, a stoic sentinel in a stained floral apron, watching as Galia meticulously lined the mahogany interior with a fresh, unscented paper towel. The atmosphere was thick with the scent of vanilla extract and the lingering, metallic tang of the Chrome Abyss where the pancake had spent its brief, dark exile. Galia used the silver-plated cocktail fork to lift Sir Pokes-a-Lot from his temporary resting place on the espresso-stained counter, her breath hitching as his curled edges brushed the cedar.

Mom sighed, a sound like dry leaves skittering across pavement. She adjusted her glasses and looked at the pancake, then at her daughter’s trembling hands. "It’s a lovely box, Galia," Mom offered, her voice carrying that signature brand of morbid optimism. "And really, you should count your blessings. At least you aren’t burying a relative in a shoebox. Your Great Uncle Arthur had to go in a plywood crate because the funeral home had a localized fire during the Great Recession. It didn't even have a lid that latched."

Galia didn't flinch at the mention of Uncle Arthur’s cut-rate interment. She was busy positioning Sir Pokes-a-Lot so his remaining chocolate-chip eye looked upward, toward the fluorescent kitchen lights. "He deserves better than plywood, Mom," Galia whispered, her voice thick with the weight of the upcoming procession. "He was a constant. He survived the Great Scrapping. He deserves the mahogany."

Amelia wandered into the kitchen, the headless dinosaur now trailing behind her by one leg. She peered over the edge of the cigar box, her blue eyes wide with curiosity. "Bye-bye," she chirped, reaching out a hand to touch the velvet. Galia gently intercepted the toddler's sticky fingers, guiding them instead to the "chin" of the pancake for one final, soft pat. The transition was complete; the pancake was no longer food, but a passenger. Galia closed the lid, the mahogany seal snapping shut on the breakfast that was, and the funeral that was to be.
