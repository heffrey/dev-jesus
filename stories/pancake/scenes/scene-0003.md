# Scene 3

## Tuesday, 10:05 AM – The Kitchen

The Laboratory of Leavening was silent, save for the rhythmic, mechanical hum of the refrigerator and the soft *pat-pat-pat* of Amelia’s bare feet against the linoleum. Galia stood frozen before the empty space on the counter where, only moments ago, a paper plate had held her most steadfast companion. The absence was a physical blow, a vacuum of starch and chocolate chips that left the room feeling hollow. Her breath hitched, a jagged sound that drew Mom’s attention from her crossword puzzle.

“He’s gone,” Galia whispered, her hands trembling as they hovered over the void. “The plate is dry, Mom. The crumb-less expanse of it… it’s a crime scene.”

Mom didn't look up, her pen hovering over a five-letter word for 'despair.' “Jeff took out the kitchen bags while you were in the shower, dear. He said something about ‘biohazards’ and ‘living mold cultures.’ Honestly, you should be grateful. At least you weren't the one stuck in the bag with him when the lid snapped shut. Imagine the claustrophobia of a polyethylene shroud.”

Galia didn’t hear the morbid comfort. She was already moving toward the back door, her eyes fixed on the gleaming, stainless steel cylinder that sat like a sentry near the exit. The Chrome Abyss. It was the terminal point for all things discarded, a silver purgatory where leftovers went to lose their identity. 

## Tuesday, 10:12 AM – The Trashcan

The lid of the trashcan opened with a pneumatic hiss, a sound Galia interpreted as a dying gasp. She peered into the depths, her nose wrinkling at the scent of discarded coffee grounds and the damp, vegetal musk of onion peels. There, resting atop a heap of eggshells and a crumpled circular for a local hardware store, lay the Glad heavy-duty bag. It was knotted tight, a plastic noose strangling the dignity of her friend. 

“I’m coming for you, Pokes,” Galia muttered, plunging her arms into the bin. 

Amelia waddled over, clutching a headless plastic dinosaur and watching with wide, blue eyes as her aunt wrestled with the refuse. “Sticky?” the toddler asked, reaching out a hand to poke the side of the silver bin. Galia ignored her, her fingers catching on the drawstring of the bag. With a heave of pure, caffeinated desperation, she hauled the black plastic mass onto the kitchen floor. 

Mom walked over, wiping her hands on her apron, her expression one of stoic curiosity. “Be careful, Galia. If you rip that open, we’ll have a different kind of funeral for the floorboards. At least it’s just breakfast food. It could be worse—you could be excavating a shallow grave in the woods during a thunderstorm with nothing but a salad fork.”

## Tuesday, 10:25 AM – The Kitchen

The "Great Scrapping" had been unkind. As Galia carefully tore a slit in the plastic, she finally laid eyes on him. Sir Pokes-a-Lot was pinned beneath a soggy tea bag, his once-proud buttermilk complexion marred by a dusting of espresso grounds. It was here, in the shift of the trash, that his left chocolate-chip eye had begun its tragic migration toward his chin. He looked weary, a battered soldier of the breakfast nook who had seen the dark side of a Jeff-led cleaning spree.

Galia lifted him with the reverence usually reserved for ancient papyrus. She carried him to the sink, using a dry paper towel to daintily whisk away the coffee silt. “Look at him, Mom. He’s broken. His structural integrity is compromised.”

“He looks like a pancake that’s been in the trash, Galia,” Mom said, leaning in to inspect the damage. “But look on the bright side. At least he didn’t get caught in the garbage disposal. That’s a violent way to go—teeth of steel, spinning at three thousand rotations per minute. To be ground into slurry and sent to the sewers? That’s a destiny for a waffle, not a knight.”

Amelia reached up, her small fingers straining toward the counter. “Cake?” she chirped, her blonde curls bouncing. Galia pulled the pancake back, shielding him from the toddler’s sensory exploration. 

“No, Amelia. This isn't cake anymore. This is a martyr.” Galia’s jaw set, her eyes gleaming with a newfound, funereal purpose. “He can't stay in the house. Jeff has desecrated the Sanctuary of Starch. We need the cigar box. We need the backyard. He deserves a horizon, not a cupboard.”
