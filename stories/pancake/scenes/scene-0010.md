# Scene 10

## Tuesday, 1:15 PM – 1:35 PM; The Garden of Gluten

Galia’s voice cracked as the final notes of the violin-heavy "Shortnin' Bread" drifted toward the neighbor’s fence. She stood at the edge of the shallow trench, the lace-edged napkin veil fluttering against her espresso-stained cheeks. With a trembling hand, she pulled a single, shimmering butter pat from the pocket of her vanilla-scented sweater. It was slightly soft from the humidity, a golden square of devotion. She leaned over the mahogany cigar box and placed the offering onto Sir Pokes-a-Lot’s chest, right beside his migrating chocolate-chip eye. 

"You were too fluffy for this world, Pokes," she whispered, her words thick with the scent of damp clay and old breakfast. "May your flip always be clean in the great non-stick beyond, and may you never know the sting of a Glad heavy-duty trash bag again." She looked up at the overcast sky, her eyes welling with a grief that felt as heavy as cold batter. To Galia, this wasn't just a circle of cooked flour; it was a companion who had witnessed her 3:00 AM period-drama marathons without a single word of judgment.

Mom stood two paces back, her floral apron damp with the afternoon mist. She adjusted her fogged glasses, her expression one of stoic, if slightly confused, empathy. She didn’t understand the sanctity of the pancake, but she understood the weight of a funeral. Behind her, Amelia sat in the weeds, her blonde hair a chaotic nest of static and dried leaves. The toddler clapped her hands together, shouting "Cake! Cake!" as she watched the golden butter pat begin to weep oily tears onto the velvet lining of the box.

The interment began with the sound of metal scraping against the stubborn, clay-heavy earth. Galia used the silver-plated cocktail fork to push the first mounds of espresso-scented dirt over the mahogany lid. Each clod of earth sounded like a muffled heartbeat hitting the wood. The smell of the burial was a confusing olfactory assault—the bitter richness of the coffee grounds clashing with the sweet, lingering aroma of vanilla extract and the metallic tang of the damp air.

Mom stepped forward, placing a comforting, flour-dusted hand on Galia’s shoulder. "There, there, Galia," Mom said, her voice a soothing drone against the hum of the nearby air conditioning unit. "It’s a tragedy, truly. But you have to look on the bright side. At least he was swept into a trash bag by Jeff and didn't have to experience the slow, agonizing rot of being forgotten behind the toaster for six months until he grew a coat of blue fur and started talking back."

Galia sobbed, a sharp, hiccuping sound that sent the lace napkin into her mouth. She pulled it out, gasping for air, and nodded at her mother’s dark brand of comfort. It was true; Sir Pokes-a-Lot had died with his dignity relatively intact, his chocolate chips still largely recognizable. She took the pink spatula she had dropped earlier and used it to pat down the mound of earth, smoothing the grave into a neat, rectangular hump of dark soil and coffee.

Amelia, sensing the climax of the ceremony, crawled forward on her hands and knees. She reached into the dirt and produced the final ceremonial object: a headless plastic dinosaur. With the solemnity of a high priestess, the sixteen-month-old shoved the dinosaur’s jagged neck into the center of the mound. It stood there, a neon-green sentinel guarding the remains of the buttermilk martyr. Galia wiped her eyes with the back of her espresso-stained hand, leaving a dark streak across her forehead.

"It’s done," Galia said, her voice regained a hollow sort of strength. She picked up the half-empty bottle of Grade A Amber maple syrup and poured a thick, sticky circle around the base of the dinosaur. It was a moat of sweetness, a final barrier against the ants that Jeff so feared. The syrup pooled in the depressions of the cocktail fork’s tracks, looking like amber blood in the grey afternoon light.

The trio stood in silence for a moment, the only sound the rhythmic rattling of the outdoor AC unit and the distant bark of a dog. The Great Griddle Homecoming was complete. Galia turned away from the Garden of Gluten, her lace veil snagging on a wilting hydrangea bush as she led the procession back toward the house. She felt a strange sense of closure; Sir Pokes-a-Lot was no longer "the reason we have ants," but a permanent resident of the earth, forever resting in his mahogany bed.
