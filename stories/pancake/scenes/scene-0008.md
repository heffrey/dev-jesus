# Scene 8

## 11:45 AM – The Garden of Gluten (Backyard)

The silver-plated cocktail fork was an inefficient shovel, but Galia refused to use the rusted spade from the shed. To use a common gardening tool would be to acknowledge Sir Pokes-a-Lot as organic waste rather than a fallen dignitary. With every frantic jab into the packed, clay-heavy earth, the fork’s tines pinged against buried pebbles, sending vibrations up Galia’s arm that matched the rhythmic thrum of the nearby air conditioning unit. Her vanilla-scented sweater, already snagged on a hydrangea bramble, pulled taut across her shoulders as she labored.

Mom stood three feet away, her arms crossed over her stained floral apron. She watched the excavation with a stoic, almost clinical detachment, her shadow stretching long and thin over the damp mulch. To Mom, the backyard was not a cemetery but a ledger of avoided catastrophes. She adjusted her glasses, the afternoon humidity already beginning to fog the lenses, and offered a nod of grim approval at the shallow, rectangular hole.

"It’s a good spot, Galia," Mom remarked, her voice cutting through the mechanical drone of the AC. "Well-drained. At least he isn’t being interred in a swamp where the peat would turn him into a bog-pancake. Think of the preserved leathery skin; he’d be a museum exhibit within a century. This is much cleaner. He’ll return to the wheat from whence he came without becoming a curiosity for future archaeologists."

## 11:58 AM – Beside the Humming AC Unit

Galia didn’t look up. She was busy lining the trench with a handful of dried grass clippings, creating a soft bed for the mahogany cigar box. Her hands trembled, still dusted with the espresso grounds she had used to 'anoint' the deceased earlier. The scent of coffee and damp earth was cloying, a bitter perfume for a bitter day. She reached for the headless plastic dinosaur that lay nearby, placing it like a silent sentinel at the head of the grave.

Amelia, the Tiny Acolyte, decided this was the moment her services were required. Crawling through the wilting greenery with the single-minded determination of a predator, she reached the edge of the trench. With a delighted shriek of "Dirt!" she scooped up a fistful of the excavated soil and flung it upward. The clods rained down on Galia’s head and the velvet-lined interior of the cigar box, which sat waiting on the grass.

"Amelia, no! This is a sanctified space!" Galia cried, batting dirt from her hair with espresso-stained fingers. The toddler didn't heed the protest; she was already reaching for the silver cocktail fork, her blue eyes wide with the desire to participate in the demolition. Amelia’s blonde hair was a chaotic halo of static and leaves, her small face set in a mask of joyous destruction that stood in stark contrast to Galia’s mounting hysteria.

## 12:15 PM – The Burial Site

Mom reached down and gently intercepted Amelia’s hand before the fork could be repurposed as a projectile. "Let her help, Galia," Mom said, her tone shifting into the low, soothing register of the Morbid Optimist. "She’s learning about the cycle of decay. It’s better she learns it here with a breakfast starch than later with something that has a pulse. At least it's just a pancake. Imagine if it were a Great Dane; we’d need a backhoe and the neighbors would definitely call the zoning board."

Galia sank back onto her heels, her breath hitching in her chest. She looked at the cigar box, where Sir Pokes-a-Lot lay in state, his mangled chocolate-chip eye staring blankly at the overcast sky. The espresso grounds gave him a rugged, weathered appearance, as if he had lived a long, arduous life before the Great Scrapping. The absurdity of the scene—the toddler, the apron, the headless dinosaur—seemed to press in on her, yet her grief remained unyielding.

She took a deep breath, smoothing the lace-edged napkin veil over her face. The humidity made the fabric cling to her skin, tasting of laundry detergent and sorrow. "It's time," Galia whispered, her voice fluttering. She signaled to the side, where the half-empty bottle of Grade A Amber maple syrup waited on the folding chair. The "Garden of Gluten" was ready. The trench was dug, the mourners were present, and the scent of betrayal hung heavy in the air.
