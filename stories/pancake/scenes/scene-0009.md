# Scene 9

## 12:40 PM - THE GARDEN OF GLUTEN

Galia moved with the heavy, deliberate gait of a widow who had seen too much. Her vanilla-scented sweater, now snagged and clinging to her shoulders in the oppressive humidity, seemed to sag under the weight of her culinary grief. Behind her, the procession was small but dutiful. Amelia, the sixteen-month-old Tiny Acolyte, toddled along with a fierce sense of purpose, her blonde hair a chaotic nest of static and dried leaves. She clutched a bright pink spatula against her chest like a holy relic, her blue eyes wide as she navigated the treacherous terrain of the lawn’s unclipped clover and rogue dandelions.

Mom followed at the rear, the stoic witness to her daughter's mourning. Her floral apron was a map of past kitchen casualties—flour dustings and berry stains—and her glasses remained perpetually fogged by the thick, Tuesday air. She watched Galia with a look of tempered patience, her lips thinned as she prepared the particular brand of dark comfort that only a woman who had survived seven decades of suburban drama could provide. To Mom, the world was a series of avoided catastrophes, and a pancake funeral was simply a detour on the road to the inevitable.

The air was thick with the scent of damp clay and the low, industrial thrum of the air conditioning unit, which rattled in its housing like a mechanical mourner. Galia clutched the mahogany cigar box to her chest, her fingers still stained with the dark espresso grounds she had used to sanctify the burial site. As they reached the lip of the trench—a shallow, jagged wound in the earth dug earlier with a silver-plated cocktail fork—she came to a halt. The lace napkin veil fluttered against her cheek, catching on the grit of the garden soil as she prepared to commit Sir Pokes-a-Lot to the deep.

## 1:10 PM - THE BURIAL SITE

Galia knelt by the hole, the "Garden of Gluten" finally claiming its namesake. She opened the lid of the cigar box one last time to ensure the deceased hadn't shifted during the journey from the porch. Sir Pokes-a-Lot lay there, a tragic disc of buttermilk and heartbreak, his single chocolate-chip eye staring vacantly up at the overcast sky. The espresso grounds clung to his golden-brown surface like ceremonial ash. Galia’s hand trembled as she lowered the box into the damp earth, the velvet lining providing a final, luxurious contrast to the cold, unforgiving clay.

"At least he didn't end up in the garbage disposal," Mom remarked, her voice cutting through the hum of the AC unit with a sharp, morbid optimism. She adjusted her fogged glasses, peering down at the trench with a grim sort of cheer. "If he'd gone down the pipes, we’d have a three-hundred-dollar plumber’s bill and a smell that would haunt the pantry until Christmas. This is much more civilized. At least you aren't burying a body that needs an autopsy. Think of how much more paperwork that would involve."

Amelia, sensing the shift in the ritual, stepped forward and dropped her pink spatula into the trench. It landed with a dull thud against the mahogany lid. "Cake," she proclaimed, her voice high and certain, as if labeling the very essence of the earth. She reached into the dirt and pulled out the headless plastic dinosaur, pressing it firmly into the mound of soil Galia began to heap over the box. It stood as a silent, prehistoric sentinel over the grave. As the final, mournful notes of the violin-heavy "Shortnin' Bread" wafted from the Bluetooth speaker, the scent of vanilla extract and betrayal finally began to dissipate into the humid afternoon.
