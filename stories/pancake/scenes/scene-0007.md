# Scene 7

## 12:05 PM – 12:18 PM / The Kitchen (The Birthplace)

Galia stood in the center of the kitchen, her fingers white-knuckled as they gripped the edge of the laminate counter. The mahogany cigar box sat before her, a silent, cedar-scented coffin for Sir Pokes-a-Lot. Despite the "Breakfast Formal" decree, she felt woefully unprepared. Her vanilla-scented sweater, still snagged from the hydrangea incident in the yard, felt like an insult to the dignity of the deceased. She needed something to signify her station as the High Priestess of Hotcakes, a shroud to mask the raw, red-rimmed evidence of her mourning.

Mom leaned against the refrigerator, her stained floral apron a map of past culinary efforts and spilled coffee. She watched Galia rummage through the junk drawer with a detached, stoic pity. To Mom, the world was a series of graduated catastrophes, and a stale pancake was a relatively low-tier disaster. Reaching into a higher cabinet, into a drawer reserved for "the good linens" that hadn't seen the light of day since the Great Thanksgiving Gravy Spill of '09, Mom pulled out a singular, lace-edged cloth napkin. It was crisp, white, and carried the weight of ancestral breakfast solemnity.

"Take this, Galia," Mom said, her voice as dry as an overcooked omelet. She handed the napkin over with the gravity of a general passing a flag. "Drape it over your face. It’ll hide the puffiness. And really, you should count your blessings. At least you aren't trying to hold this funeral in the middle of a swarm of locusts that would have stripped Sir Pokes-a-Lot to his glutenous bones before you could even say a prayer. It could be much more traumatic."

Galia took the napkin, her trembling hands smoothing the lace. The "Morbid Optimist" had a way of making one feel both comforted and deeply unsettled. Galia didn't care about the locusts; she only cared about the six-inch buttermilk hero currently resting on a bed of crimson velvet and espresso grounds. She tucked the napkin into her pocket, gathered the cigar box, and signaled for the procession to begin.

## 12:20 PM – 12:35 PM / The Backyard (The Garden of Gluten)

They migrated to the Garden of Gluten, a slow, somber procession of three under the heavy, humid gloom of the Tuesday afternoon. The air conditioning unit hummed a mechanical dirge, its rhythmic vibration rattling the damp earth near the freshly dug trench. Amelia toddled at the rear in the role of the Tiny Acolyte. She clutched her headless plastic dinosaur in one hand, its jagged neck a reminder of the "Great Scrapping," and in the other, she held a half-empty bottle of Grade A Amber maple syrup. Her blue eyes were wide, reflecting a toddler’s confusion at the sudden, hushed importance of the backyard.

Galia stopped at the head of the trench and unfurled the lace napkin. With the practiced grace of a grieving widow in a silent film, she fashioned it into a veil, pinning it precariously to her hair. The world turned into a fractured, white-latticed dreamscape. Through the lace, the wilting greenery of the garden looked like an impressionist painting of despair. She looked down at the cigar box, where Sir Pokes-a-Lot waited for his final flip into the void.

"Flower girl," Galia whispered, her voice fluttering. Amelia, sensing the cue, didn't throw petals. Instead, she stepped forward and tilted the syrup bottle over the open trench. A single, viscous glob of amber liquid fell onto the dirt—a sticky, sweet libation for the departed. Mom stood to the side, her arms crossed over her floral apron, watching the scene with the stoicism of a gargoyle.

As Galia prepared to deliver the eulogy, the scent of damp soil mixed with the faint, lingering aroma of vanilla extract. She reached into her pocket for her grease-stained index card, her breath fogging the delicate lace of her veil. The burial site was ready. The "Garden of Gluten" was quiet, save for the hum of the AC and the distant, mocking chirp of a bird that clearly didn't understand the magnitude of the loss. Sir Pokes-a-Lot was home, or as close to home as a pancake could get when the trashcan was no longer an option.
