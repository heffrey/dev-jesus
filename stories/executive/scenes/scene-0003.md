# Scene 3

## 5:42 PM – The Scranton Greyhound Station

The bus door hissed open with a pneumatic sigh, releasing a cloud of pressurized air that smelled of stale tobacco and overheated rubber. Elias stepped onto the cracked asphalt, his boots clicking against a surface that hadn't been resurfaced in a decade.

Here, the resolution of the world felt lower, the textures muddy and muted compared to the hyper-sharp, 8K clarity of the Manhattan Monolith. In Scranton, the simulation didn't bother with the polish; it let the edges fray.

He felt the weight of the wool overcoat—a standard, mass-produced garment—pressing against his shoulders. It was heavy in a way his bespoke silks never were, providing a grounding friction that anchored his consciousness to the local coordinates. A fit of coughing seized him, deep and wet, leaving the familiar metallic tang of copper on his tongue. It wasn't just a symptom of the illness he had scripted for this exit; it was the taste of the hardware failing, a reminder that this specific instance was never meant for long-term persistence.

The station was a cathedral of low-frequency hums and flickering fluorescent lights. To his left, a vending machine buzzed with a dying transformer, a sound that Elias found strangely comforting. In the high-altitude vacuum of the 88th Floor, silence was an expensive commodity, a sterile void. Here, the noise was thick and honest. He began the two-mile walk toward the South Side, his gait uneven as his nervous system struggled to calibrate to the uneven sidewalks and the heavy, humid air of the Lackawanna Valley.

## 6:15 PM – The Miller Street Ascent

As he turned onto Miller Street, the neighborhood rose to meet him like a half-remembered dream. The houses were narrow, wood-slatted skeletons huddling together for warmth against the encroaching dusk. This was the "source code" of his human identity, the base layer upon which the Elias Thorne persona had been crudely compiled. He passed a chain-link fence overgrown with invasive vines, the metal rusting into a fine orange powder that stained his fingers when he brushed against it.

The metallic taste in his mouth intensified, a sharp, electric hum that vibrated in his molars. It was the signal-to-noise ratio of his humanity narrowing. Every step was an exercise in sensory processing: the smell of coal dust lingering in the soil, the distant bark of a dog that sounded like a looping audio file, the biting chill of the wind. He was no longer the architect of his environment; he was a guest in a dying subroutine, subject to the same laws of decay as the porches sagging under the weight of wet snow.

He stopped in front of a streetlamp that flickered with a rhythmic, three-beat stutter. In his former life, he would have called the city's utility board or bought the company that manufactured the bulb to fix the glitch. Now, he simply watched the light pulse, recognizing it as a beautiful, unintended consequence of a system under stress. He was looking for the friction, the places where reality rubbed against the soul until both were raw.

## 6:30 PM – 142 Miller Street

The Scranton House stood at the end of the block, a decaying, hollowed-out husk that looked more like a shadow than a structure. It was the physical manifestation of the soul Jim had abandoned in his pursuit of the Gilded Reach. The porch steps groaned under his weight, a structural protest that echoed through the quiet street. The white paint was no longer white; it was a cartography of neglect, peeling away in long, brittle strips to reveal the gray, weathered wood beneath.

Elias reached into his pocket and pulled out a heavy brass key, an archaic piece of physical security that felt absurd after years of biometric scanners and encrypted proximity fobs. The lock was stubborn, seized by years of grit and oxidation. He leaned his shoulder into the door, forcing the mechanism to yield. With a sharp *crack* of splintering wood and protesting hinges, the house exhaled—a heavy, stagnant breath of dust, old newsprint, and the faint, sweet rot of forgotten wallpaper paste.

He stepped into the entryway, the darkness of the interior swallowing the dim streetlight. He didn't reach for a light switch; he knew the grid had been disconnected years ago. Instead, he stood in the foyer, letting his eyes adjust to the gloom. This was the cenotaph of his origin. Here, stripped of the Thorne Industries empire and the monochromatic nihilism of the Monolith, the engineer was finally alone with the machine. He slumped against the wall, sliding down until he sat on the floorboards, the metallic tang in his throat now a full-bodied ache, waiting for the house to tell him what he had forgotten.
