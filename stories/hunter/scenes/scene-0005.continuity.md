- Location: Cedar farmhouse with gabled roofs and peeling paint; main door is secured with a heavy iron bolt.
- Time of Day: Transitions from twilight through dusk to absolute nightfall.
- Character State (Annie): Flayed shins and crusted scratch on cheek; trembling from adrenaline crash; using a flashlight upstairs.
- Character State (Sarah): Profound physical exhaustion/paralysis; vacant, pale, and "sleepwalker-like" in the kitchen.
- Antagonist State (Dale): Standing at the base of the porch steps; calm/calculating; knows structural weaknesses like creaky boards and swollen windows.
- Plot Revelation: Dale has discarded his "neighborly" facade to hunt them; the farmhouse is no longer a haven but a "trap" under siege.
