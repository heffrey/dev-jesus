# Scene 4

## Late Afternoon - The Deep Woods

The undergrowth clawed at Annie’s shins, thorns snagging on her denim as she lunged through the dense thicket. Beside her, Sarah’s breath came in ragged, rhythmic hitches, a stark contrast to the oppressive silence of the towering pines. Behind them, the heavy crunch of boots on dry needles signaled Dale’s steady progress—a sound not of a man running, but of a predator who knew the terrain far better than his prey. Every snap of a twig felt like a gunshot in the stagnant, humid air.

They scrambled over a moss-slicked log, the damp smell of decay rising to meet them. Annie’s heart hammered against her ribs, a frantic bird trapped in a cage of bone. She glanced back, catching a flicker of movement through the shifting leaves—a dark shape weaving through the grey trunks with unnerving fluidity. It wasn't just the speed that terrified her; it was the deliberate nature of it. Dale wasn't shouting or calling out; he was simply coming, his presence a heavy weight at their backs.

Sarah grabbed Annie’s sleeve, pulling her toward a narrow ravine choked with dead leaves and skeletal ferns. They slid down the embankment, the world spinning in a blur of brown and grey. At the bottom, they pressed themselves into the cold earth beneath an overhanging shelf of rock, their bodies trembling in unison. They held their breath until their lungs burned, listening as the rhythmic thud of Dale’s footsteps passed along the ridge above, eventually fading into the mournful groan of the wind through the high canopy.

## Twilight - The Edge of the Ridge

The shadows stretched into long, skeletal fingers across the forest floor as the light began to fail, turning the vibrant green of the canopy into a bruised purple. Annie slumped against the damp stone, her fingers trembling as she wiped a smear of mud and iron-scented blood from a scratch on her cheek. Sarah sat opposite her, staring into the middle distance with eyes that seemed too large for her face. The adrenaline was beginning to ebb, leaving behind a cold, hollow ache and the terrifying realization that they were miles from any paved road.

"He isn't going to stop," Sarah whispered, her voice barely audible over the rustle of the trees. The gravity of their situation settled over them like a shroud. Dale’s face, usually masked by a practiced, neighborly indifference back at the outskirts of town, had been transformed during the ambush—sharpened by a singular, violent purpose. He wasn't a man they could reason with or hide from for long; he was a hunter who viewed them as nothing more than panicked quarry.

In the deepening gloom, Old Man Henderson’s cryptic warning from the previous evening echoed with newfound clarity. He had spoken of the darkness that lived in the marrow of the valley, of men who lost their souls to the isolation of the timber. They had dismissed him as a relic of local superstition, a man gone soft in the head from too much solitude. Now, as the first stars pricked through the darkening sky, Annie realized the "shadow" Henderson had warned them about was standing somewhere in the trees, waiting for the world to go black.
