# Scene 10

## The Farmhouse – Upstairs Hallway, Night

The floorboards groaned under Dale’s weight, a rhythmic, predatory measurement of the space between them. Sarah pushed Annie toward the narrow staircase, her hand white-knuckled around the heavy iron fireplace poker. The air in the farmhouse was thick with the scent of wet dust and the metallic tang of Sarah’s mounting dread. Dale emerged from the kitchen shadows, the silver-bladed folding knife catching a stray glint of moonlight from a cracked window. His sweat-stained trucker hat was pulled low, but the scar above his left eye seemed to pulse in the dim light. He didn’t rush; he moved with the terrifying patience of a man who knew every exit was bolted.

"End of the line, Sarah," Dale said, his voice a dry rasp that barely carried over the rhythmic rain on the tin roof. He stepped over a muddy print on the foyer rug, his boots making a dull thud. Sarah didn't answer with words. As Annie scrambled up the stairs, her raw, weeping shins screaming with every movement, Sarah swung the iron poker. It was a desperate, wide arc meant to create distance, but Dale moved with a fluidity that defied his rugged frame. He dipped inside the swing, the silver blade flashing in a blur of practiced lethality.

The sound was sickening—a wet, soft puncture followed by Sarah’s sharp intake of breath. She didn't scream; she only grunted, the poker clattering against the banister as she fell back against the stairs. Blood, dark and hot, began to blossom across the front of her shirt. Dale didn't follow up immediately. He stood at the base of the stairs, cleaning the blade on his sleeve with a slow, methodical stroke. He looked up at Annie, his eyes dead and calculating, showing no emotion beyond the grim determination of a job nearing its completion. "Shoulda stayed in the woods," he clipped.

## The Farmhouse – Master Bedroom, Night

Annie hauled her mother into the master bedroom, the heavy iron bolt on the door sliding into place with a finality that felt like a coffin lid closing. Sarah slumped against the floral wallpaper, her breath coming in ragged, wet rattles. The room smelled of lavender sachet and the copper stench of the wound. Outside, the loblolly pines thrashed against the siding like skeletal fingers trying to get in. Annie tore at her own shirt to make a bandage, her hands shaking so violently she could barely grip the fabric. "Stay with me, Mom," she whispered, her optimism finally fracturing into jagged shards of panic.

Sarah reached out, her fingers staining Annie’s sleeve red. "Listen," she wheezed, the fierce protector in her eyes flickering but not yet extinguished. "He... he isn't just looking for us, Annie. He’s looking for what’s in your blood." Sarah coughed, a spray of crimson hitting the floor. She told her then—the secret she had buried beneath years of survival drills and hidden paths. Dale hadn't been sent by a stranger; he was the shadow of a debt Sarah’s own father had defaulted on. The "Hunter" wasn't just a man; it was a consequence, a cold trade made in the Piney Woods decades ago. Annie wasn't just the prey; she was the final piece of an inheritance Dale had been hired to collect.

The realization hit Annie harder than any physical blow. The "Hunter" was a constant because the family was the lure. Every track Sarah had taught her to read, every hiding spot in the backwoods, had been preparation for this inevitable harvest. "You have to be... harder than him," Sarah gasped, her grip on Annie’s arm tightening one last time before her strength began to fail. The weight of the sacrifice, the years of looking over their shoulders, finally made sense. It wasn't a random cruelty; it was an inheritance of blood and iron that Annie was now forced to claim.

## The Farmhouse – The Threshold, Night

The scratching started again. It wasn't a frantic clawing, but the slow, deliberate scrape of a silver blade against the wood of the bedroom door. Dale was there, standing in the dark hallway, listening to Sarah’s fading pulse. Annie stood up, her hitching breath smoothing out into something colder, something more precise. She looked down at the iron poker she had managed to snatch before retreating. The fear was still there, a cold knot in her stomach, but it was being overwritten by a new, grim resolve. She was no longer just the daughter trying to run; she was the progeny of a line that knew how to survive the woods.

"Annie," Dale’s voice came through the wood, clipped and certain. "Open it. Make it quick." He wasn't taunting her; he was simply stating a professional preference. The house creaked, the old wood settling under the weight of the storm and the two predators separated by a single inch of oak. Annie didn't reply. She moved away from the door, her steps silent despite the pain in her shins. She looked at her mother’s still form and then back at the door, her eyes mirroring the dead, calculating look she had seen in Dale’s.

She began to move the heavy dresser, not to block the door further, but to create a funnel—a kill zone. She remembered everything Old Man Henderson had whispered about the hidden paths and everything Sarah had taught her about a predator’s blind spot. The resilience that had been her strength was hardening into a weapon. As the first splinter of the door wood cracked under Dale’s shoulder, Annie gripped the iron poker. The hunt wasn't over; it was merely changing hands. The girl who hoped was gone, replaced by the woman who would ensure there was no one left to follow.
