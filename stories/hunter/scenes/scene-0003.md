# Scene 3

## Late Night / The Farmhouse

The red 1985 Camaro rolled into the overgrown driveway of the Farmhouse, its engine giving a final, shuddering cough before falling silent. The rhythmic *tink-tink-tink* of the cooling metal was the only sound in the yard, a mechanical heartbeat fading into the oppressive quiet of the Texas night. Sarah didn't move immediately; her hands remained locked at ten and two on the steering wheel, her eyes narrow and predatory as she scanned the peeling white porch and the dark, skeletal silhouettes of the Woods that crowded the property line. The Spanish moss draped over the nearby live oaks looked like jagged tears in the sky, swaying in a wind that Annie couldn't feel.

Annie sat in the passenger seat, her fingers tracing the edge of the folding knife in her pocket. The air inside the car felt thick, shimmering with a visual density that made her head ache. Outside, the Farmhouse looked less like a sanctuary and more like a low-resolution memory, its edges blurring where the weathered wood met the deep shadows of the porch. To Annie, the house seemed to vibrate at a frequency just outside of hearing, a subtle oscillation that suggested the structure was struggling to maintain its form against the encroaching dark.

"Stay behind me," Sarah whispered, her voice a low rasp that cut through the sensory static. She reached down and retrieved the heavy wrench from the footwell, her knuckles white around the cold iron. She opened the door with practiced silence, stepping out into the mud that never fully dried. Annie followed, her boots crunching softly on the carpet of pine needles. The scent of decaying leaves and that sharp, metallic "wrongness" was stronger here, clinging to the damp air like a physical weight.

## The Interior / The Kitchen

Inside, the Farmhouse was a tomb of dust and stagnant air. Sarah moved through the downstairs rooms with economical grace, her movements purposeful as she checked the locks and adjusted the heavy, light-blocking curtains. She didn't flick the switches; the hum of the electrical grid felt too much like the digital bell chime they had heard on the Road, a signal they weren't ready to answer. Instead, she relied on the slivers of bruised moonlight that managed to pierce the gloom, her silhouette a jagged shadow against the gray-weathered walls.

Annie stood in the center of the kitchen, her hand resting on the scarred wooden table. She felt a wave of nausea roll through her, a systemic rejection of the reality around her. When she looked down at her hand, the skin seemed to flicker, the grain of the wood visible through her palm for a fraction of a second before the image snapped back into focus. The "fraying" was getting worse. The world felt thin, like the hand-drawn vellum map tucked into her jacket—a beautiful, fragile layer stretched over a void of cold logic.

"Eat something," Sarah commanded, appearing from the shadows of the hallway. She held out a sleeve of the stale crackers from Henderson’s. Her eyes were hard, searching Annie’s face for signs of the degradation she knew was coming. Sarah was the anchor, the one who refused to acknowledge the glitches, treating the collapsing simulation with the grim pragmatism of a soldier in a foxhole. To her, survival wasn't about understanding the signal; it was about outlasting the noise.

## Upstairs / The Bedroom

They retreated to the upstairs bedroom, the one with the window facing the old logging road. The springs of the bed groaned as Annie sat down, the sound echoing with an artificial reverb that made her flinch. She placed the vellum map and her folding knife on the nightstand, side-by-side. The map seemed to pulse with a faint, internal light, the ink lines of the bypass route shimmering like cooling embers. It was a corrective script, a piece of code meant to guide them through a world that was increasingly failing to render.

Sarah stood by the window, peering through a gap in the curtains. The heavy wrench was never more than an arm's length away. She looked out at the Woods, watching for the matte black glint of Dale’s truck or the unnatural flicker of an "iteration" trying to resolve. "Sleep," she said, though she remained standing, a sentinel against the darkness. "We move at dawn. The signal is stronger in the light."

Annie lay back, staring up at the ceiling where the shadows of the pine trees danced in a way that defied the laws of optics. She thought of the "Engineer" the map hinted at, the one who had entered this crumbling reality as a constrained instance just to find them. She wondered if he felt the same nausea she did, or if he saw the world for what it truly was—a series of fading variables and degrading signals. As she drifted into a fitful sleep, the last thing she heard wasn't the wind in the pines, but the distant, rhythmic hum of a processor laboring under an impossible load.
