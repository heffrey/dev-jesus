# Scene 7

## The Farmhouse - Night

Dale moved along the perimeter of the cedar siding with the silent, practiced gait of a man who had spent more nights in the woods than in a bed. He didn't rush. The hunt was a sequence of deliberate pressures, and right now, he was looking for the point of least resistance. He reached the mudroom door at the rear of the house, his sweat-stained trucker hat pulled low against the moonlight. He pressed his calloused palm against the wood, feeling the vibration of the house—the way it breathed, the way it settled. He knew this era of construction; the wood would be swollen from the East Texas humidity, making the frames tight but the joints brittle.

He pulled a heavy-bladed folding knife from his pocket, the click of the lock echoing sharply in the humid air. He didn't intend to carve his way in yet; he simply used the butt of the handle to tap rhythmically against the doorframe, a hollow sound that would carry through the floorboards like a heartbeat. He wanted them to hear him. He wanted Sarah to feel the weight of his presence on the other side of that thin barrier. The scar above his left eye throbbed with a dull, familiar heat, a phantom reminder of the last time a cornered animal had fought back. Dale relished it. He took a slow, deep breath, inhaling the scent of old wood and the metallic tang of the coming rain.

Moving to the kitchen window, he peered through a sliver of a gap in the heavy curtains. He could see the faint, flickering glow of a flashlight reflected off the dusty linoleum inside. They were moving. He watched the shadow of Annie pass through the kitchen, noting the slight hitch in her stride from her injured legs. She was resilient, he’d give her that. But resilience was just another word for a longer chase. He tapped the glass once, a sharp, crystalline note, and then stepped back into the shadows of the loblolly pines, disappearing before the light could find him.

## The Farmhouse - Hallway

Inside, the sound of the tap against the glass acted like an electric shock to Sarah. The catatonic glaze vanished from her eyes, replaced by the hard, diamond-sharp focus of the Protector. She didn't scream; she didn't even gasp. Instead, she reached out and caught Annie’s arm, her grip iron-tight and grounding. The "sleepwalker" was gone, and in her place stood the woman who had taught her daughter how to read tracks in the mud of the Piney Woods. "The sideboard," Sarah whispered, her voice a low, raspy command. "Now."

Annie winced as she put weight on her flayed shins, the pain a searing reminder of their flight through the underbrush. She didn't complain. Together, they gripped the edges of the heavy oak sideboard that sat in the hallway, a massive piece of furniture that had belonged to Annie’s grandmother. It was filled with heavy ceramic plates and tarnished silver, making it a dead weight. They shoved it across the floorboards, the screech of wood on wood sounding like a dying animal in the silent house. They wedged it firmly against the back door, Sarah using her shoulder to jam it into place until the frame groaned.

"He's testing us," Sarah said, her movements economical and purposeful as she moved to the front door to check the heavy iron bolt. She looked at Annie, her face pale but her expression absolute. "He wants us to panic, to run out into the dark where he’s got the advantage. We stay put. This house is ours, and we know every inch of it that he don't." She grabbed a heavy fireplace poker from the hearth, weighing it in her hand. Annie nodded, mirroring her mother’s resolve, though her hands still trembled slightly. They were no longer just hiding; they were fortifying.

## The Farmhouse - Upstairs

By the time they retreated to the upper floor, the house felt less like a home and more like a wooden cage. Annie stood by the window of her childhood bedroom, her forehead pressed against the cool glass. She peered through the gap in the curtains toward the blacktop road in the distance. It was a ribbon of silver under the moon, empty and indifferent. There would be no Sheriff Miller coming down that road tonight, and no help from Henderson’s station. They were isolated, tucked away in a fold of the Texas landscape that the rest of the world had forgotten.

Downstairs, a floorboard creaked—not the random settling of an old house, but the rhythmic, deliberate weight of someone stepping onto the porch. Dale was back. Annie felt a cold shiver crawl down her spine as she heard the slow, steady scrape of metal against the front door’s lock. He wasn't trying to hide anymore. He was letting them know that the siege had truly begun. Sarah stood at the top of the stairs, her silhouette framed by the dim light of the hallway, the poker held at her side like a soldier’s rifle.

The atmosphere in the room grew thick, the humidity of the night seeming to seep through the very walls. Every sound was magnified: the rustle of the Spanish moss against the siding, the distant hoot of an owl, and the scratching of Dale’s knife against the porch wood. Annie looked at her mother and saw the fierce, absolute love that had kept them alive this far. They were the prey, but they weren't helpless. As the first drops of rain began to drum against the missing shingles of the roof, Annie reached out and took her mother’s hand, both of them staring down into the darkness of the stairwell, waiting for the first breach.
