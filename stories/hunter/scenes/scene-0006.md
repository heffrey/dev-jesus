# Scene 6

## Night - The Farmhouse

The interior of the farmhouse was a cage of long shadows and stale air. Sarah stood by the heavy iron bolt of the front door, her fingers resting on the cold metal as if she could feel Dale’s presence through the wood. The vacant, sleepwalker-like glaze remained in her eyes, a hollow expression that made her look older than her years. She didn’t move when the floorboards groaned under Annie’s weight, her focus entirely consumed by the perimeter of their shrinking world. The scent of wood rot and old dust, once the familiar perfume of home, now felt cloying and thick, like the air in a tomb.

Annie moved through the kitchen, her movements jerky and forced. She kept the flashlight aimed low, the beam cutting a narrow path across the linoleum. Every sound from outside—the rhythmic chirr of cicadas, the snap of a dry branch in the Piney Woods—sounded like a footstep. She could still see the image of Dale standing at the base of the porch steps in her mind’s eye, his sweat-stained trucker hat a dark blotch against the twilight. He wasn’t a man so much as a force of nature, a predator waiting for the inevitable lapse in their resolve. 

"Mom, we need to go up," Annie whispered, her voice cracking. Sarah didn't turn, but her shoulders slumped an inch, the physical manifestation of the weight she carried. The house, which Sarah had spent years turning into a sanctuary, had betrayed them; it was now a landmark, a fixed point for a hunter who thrived on the static. They were no longer living in a home; they were occupying a target. Sarah finally let her hand drop from the bolt, her movements economical and drained of all warmth as she turned toward the stairs.

## Night - Upstairs Bedroom

In the upstairs bedroom, the darkness was even more absolute. Annie sat on the edge of the moth-eaten quilt, the flashlight resting on the nightstand and casting a ghoulish glow toward the ceiling. She tended to her injuries with shaking hands, dabbing at the crusted scratch on her cheek and the flayed skin of her shins with a damp cloth. The water in the basin was soon pink, a reminder of the frantic flight through the deep woods. Beside her, Sarah sat perfectly still, staring at the heavy curtains that blocked the view of the driveway. Sarah wasn't resting; she was listening, her ears tuned to the specific frequency of a threat.

The silence of the house was deceptive, layered with the subtle shifts of the settling structure. Annie looked at her mother, seeing the "Protector" reduced to a state of hyper-vigilance that bordered on paralysis. They had been taught to read tracks and hide in the brush, but those skills felt useless against a man who knew the structural weaknesses of their very walls. The knowledge that Dale was out there, perhaps sitting on the porch or circling the perimeter with his dead, calculating eyes, made the act of "getting ready for bed" feel like a grotesque pantomime.

Annie crawled onto the mattress, keeping her boots on. She didn't close her eyes. Through a small gap in the heavy curtains, she could see a sliver of the blacktop road in the distance, a pale ribbon under the moon. Somewhere in the darkness between the house and that road, the Hunter was waiting. He was patient, his methodical nature ensuring he wouldn't rush the kill. As the wind rattled a loose shingle on the roof, Annie reached out and took her mother’s hand. Sarah’s grip was like iron—not out of affection, but out of a desperate, primal need to ensure her progeny was still within reach. In the suffocating dark of the farmhouse, sleep was a luxury they could no longer afford.
