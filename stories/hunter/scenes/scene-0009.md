# Scene 9

## Night / The Farmhouse - The Entryway

The front door didn't shatter; it yielded with a long, agonizing groan of protesting timber. Dale didn't rush through the opening. He stepped over the threshold with the measured grace of a man walking into his own living room, his boots leaving wet, muddy prints on the floral rug Sarah had vacuumed only yesterday. He paused in the foyer, the silver-bladed folding knife held loosely at his side. The rain hammered against the tin roof, a frantic, percussive sound that filled the sudden vacuum of the house. Dale adjusted his sweat-stained trucker hat, his dead eyes scanning the shadows of the hallway for any sign of movement. 

The scar above Dale’s left eye throbbed with a dull, rhythmic heat. He could smell them—not just the scent of the lavender soap they used, but the sharp, metallic tang of adrenaline and the salt of Annie’s tears. He took a slow breath, tasting the stale air of the farmhouse. To him, the house wasn't a home; it was a series of choke points and blind corners. He began to move, his weight shifted forward, his footsteps nearly silent despite the heavy soles of his boots. He was a professional, and he took a perverse pleasure in the way the house seemed to shrink around his presence.

Upstairs, Sarah stood at the top of the landing, the heavy iron fireplace poker held across her chest. She heard the soft *snick* of the knife blade locking into place downstairs. Her face was a mask of hard, practical resolve, though her heart hammered against her ribs like a trapped bird. Beside her, Annie leaned against the wall, her breath coming in shallow hitches. The flayed skin on Annie's shins was raw and weeping, the pain a constant, white-hot reminder of the world outside. Sarah reached out, her hand calloused and firm, and squeezed Annie’s shoulder. There was no softness in the gesture, only the grim promise of a protector who had run out of room to retreat.

## Night / The Farmhouse - The Hidden Passage

"Not the stairs," Sarah whispered, the sound barely audible over the storm. She knew Dale would expect them to bolt for the back bedroom or try to barricade the master suite. Instead, she led Annie toward the linen closet at the end of the narrow hallway. Sarah reached behind the stacks of folded quilts, her fingers finding a recessed latch in the cedar paneling. With a dull click, a section of the wall swung inward, revealing a cramped, lightless void that smelled of insulation and old dust. It was a service crawlspace, a relic of the house’s original construction that ran between the walls of the kitchen and the dining room.

Annie hesitated, looking into the black maw of the passage. Her optimism, usually her greatest strength, was flickering in the face of Dale’s relentless pursuit. She looked at her mother, seeing the heavy weight of every sacrifice Sarah had ever made etched into the lines around her eyes. Annie nodded once, swallowing her fear, and stepped into the darkness. She moved with a noticeable hitch in her stride, her injured legs protesting as she lowered herself into the narrow gap. Sarah followed, pulling the panel shut behind them just as the first heavy footfall creaked on the bottom step of the main staircase.

Inside the wall, the world was reduced to the sound of their own breathing and the muffled vibrations of Dale’s movements. The space was tight, forcing them to press against the rough-hewn studs. Annie closed her eyes, trying to visualize the house she had grown up in, now transformed into a labyrinth of lethal intent. She felt the vibration of Dale’s boots through the floorboards—he was moving toward the bedrooms, his pace steady and unhurried. He was searching every closet, every trunk, his methodical nature turning the house into a trap of his own making.

## Night / The Farmhouse - The Kitchen & Pantry

Dale stood in the center of the upstairs hallway, his head tilted as he listened to the house. The rain was a constant roar, but he was trained to hear the inconsistencies—the shift of weight, the catch of a breath. He frowned, the scar above his eye twitching. They weren't in the rooms. He turned back toward the stairs, his movements economical and purposeful. He hadn't seen them leave, and there were no tracks leading out the windows. He descended the stairs, his knife catching the dim light from the porch lamp outside, the silver blade gleaming like a predator’s tooth.

In the kitchen, he paused by the pantry door. He ran his hand over the doorframe, feeling the slight vibration of the house. He was close. He could feel the pressure of their presence, like the static charge before a lightning strike. He opened the pantry door, the hinges screaming in the silence. He stepped inside, his eyes tracking over the cans of peaches and jars of preserved green beans. He plunged his knife into a sack of flour, the white powder spilling out like a slow bleed. He was smiling now, a thin, joyless expression that never reached his calculating eyes.

Behind the thin lath and plaster of the pantry wall, Sarah held the fireplace poker ready. She could see Dale through a narrow crack in the wood—the sweat-stained brim of his hat, the cold precision of his movements. He was inches away, separated only by a layer of pine and wallpaper. Annie stood behind her, her hand over her mouth to stifle a sob, her eyes wide with the realization of how thin the line was between survival and the end. Dale paused, his knife hovering near the very panel they were hiding behind, his head turning slowly as if he could sense the heat of their bodies through the wood. He stayed there for a long moment, a silent sentinel in the dark, before turning and stepping back into the kitchen.
