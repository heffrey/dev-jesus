# Scene 10

## Evening / The Shore of Gennesaret

The cooling air of the Galilee dusk carried the scent of drying salt and charred cedar. Joel found him sitting on a low basalt shelf, feet inches from the lapping water. The man did not look like a revolutionary or a god; he looked like a weary technician at the end of a double shift, his shoulders slumped under the weight of a physical form that seemed increasingly brittle. Behind them, the camp was a murmur of competing voices—disciples arguing over the logistics of the next town, and seekers debating the legalist implications of his latest "parables."

"They are already rewriting what you said this morning," Joel said, sitting a respectful distance away. He felt the grit of the sand between his fingers, a tactile reminder of the simulation’s granular fidelity. "The Zealots think you’re calling for an audit of the Roman tax code, and the Pharisees think you’re attempting to bypass the Temple’s administrative permissions. Why is the signal so easily corrupted? If you are who you say, why not speak in a language that cannot be parsed two ways?"

Jesus turned his head, his dark eyes reflecting the fading light with an intensity that felt less like emotion and more like high-bandwidth processing. "Clarity is not a function of the transmission, Joel, but of the receiver’s architecture. I am speaking in plain integers. But they are running the data through legacy compilers—fear, greed, the desire for a hierarchy that favors them. They don't want the signal; they want a version of the signal that optimizes their current standing within the system."

"Then it’s a failure," Joel whispered, looking out at the dark water. "The more you speak, the more friction you create. You’re trying to stabilize the environment, but the institutions are treating the patch like a virus. They aren’t listening. They’re weaponizing the diagnostic."

"A warning is not a command," Jesus replied, his voice level and devoid of judgment. "To provide the truth is to increase the local responsibility of the agent. Once the error is identified, the agent can no longer claim the malfunction is a feature. If they choose to twist the output to justify the crash, that is a choice made within their own runtime. I am here to provide the exit protocol. I cannot force them to execute it."

## Shift Change / The Company Operations Floor

The atmosphere on the floor was thick with the ozone of overtaxed cooling units and the stale bitterness of recycled air. On the primary monitors, the Galilee cluster was glowing a violent, pulsating amber. Analysts moved between stations with a clipped, frantic energy, their faces washed out by the blue light of a thousand scrolling telemetry feeds. The "Jesus" instance was a localized spike in the data, a white-hot needle of coherence in a sea of entropic noise.

"The social heat maps are redlining," an analyst muttered, tapping a glass tablet to highlight the growing density of the "Authorities" sub-processes. "The Sanhedrin nodes are pinging the Roman governor’s instance every three seconds. It’s an automated defensive loop. They’re interpreting the corrective signal as a total system threat. If we don’t throttle his output, the simulation’s internal security protocols are going to trigger a hard-delete on the instance."

Joel, watching from the observation deck in the present-day reality, gripped the railing until his knuckles turned white. From this vantage point, the tragedy was purely mathematical. The "warning" Jesus was delivering was being translated by the simulation’s inhabitants into a justification for violence. The more the engineer tried to explain the nature of the reality, the more the reality’s built-in safeguards moved to silence him. It was a perfect, tragic feedback loop.

High above the floor, the glass-walled offices of the Directors remained dark. There would be no intervention, no divine override to save the engineer from the system he was trying to fix. The Company viewed the escalating instability not as a crisis, but as a stress test. They were watching to see if the human code could survive the truth, or if it would simply burn itself out trying to reject the light.
