# Scene 8

## MID-DAY – CAPERNAUM: THE GARRISON PRECINCT

The room was a heavy box of basalt and shadow, smelling of old sweat and the sharp, metallic tang of Roman iron. Joel sat on a stone bench, his hands knotted together until the knuckles turned white. Across from him, a Temple official named Eleazar did not look like a man concerned with blasphemy. He looked like an auditor facing a catastrophic ledger error. He leaned forward, the oil lamp between them flickering with a rhythmic, digital stutter that only Joel seemed to notice.

"We do not care for his interpretations of the Law, Joel bar-Jude," Eleazar said, his voice flat and weary. "The Law is robust; it can withstand a peasant’s eccentricities. What we cannot withstand is the cessation of the grain-loop. Since your 'Signal' began his broadcasts in the hills, three fishing cooperatives have liquidated their assets. They aren't selling for profit; they are simply walking away from the nets. They say the 'alignment' is coming and the currency of the city has no value."

Joel looked at the wall behind Eleazar. For a second, the stone blurred into a vertical cascade of amber light before snapping back into solid grey. "He isn't telling them to quit," Joel whispered, his throat dry. "He’s telling them the system is failing. He’s providing a patch. If you saw the way he fixed my brother—not with a prayer, but with a... a recalibration—you would understand. The old incentives don't work when you realize the room you're standing in is hollow."

Eleazar slammed a hand on the table, the sound echoing with a hollow, processed thud. "The 'system,' as you call it, is what keeps the peace. If the laborers stop believing in the necessity of the harvest, the city starves. If they stop fearing the debt-cycle, the social architecture collapses. Your Yeshua isn't a prophet; he is a logic-bomb. He is stripping the motivation from the population, and a population without motivation is a dead asset. Tell us where the Signal is broadcasting from, or we will have to initiate a manual override of your own status."

## SIMULTANEOUS – THE OPERATIONS FLOOR (SECTOR 7G)

The air in Sector 7G was thirty degrees cooler than the dusty heat of Capernaum, smelling of ozone and ionized air. On the primary volumetric display, the town of Capernaum was a pulsing hive of amber nodes. One node, labeled *INSTANCE: J_NAZARENE*, was glowing with a dangerous, incandescent violet. Around it, the surrounding nodes were losing their "Engagement" telemetry. The graphs were plummeting into a flatline of apathy.

"He’s breaking the incentive loops," a Senior Technician muttered, her fingers dancing across a haptic interface. "Look at the labor-metrics in the Galilee sector. The agents are stopping their routine tasks. They're drifting toward the Signal. If we don't restore the scarcity-drive, the social simulation will hit a terminal stagnation point within three cycles. The 'Kingdom' data-packet he’s uploading is essentially a post-scarcity virus."

A supervisor leaned over her shoulder, his face illuminated by the cold light of the Archive's reflection. "The Board won't allow a hard-reset yet; the sunk costs are too high. But we can't let the Signal keep broadcasting. It’s not just theology; it’s a direct attack on the simulation's resource management. Activate the local defensive sub-routines. Increase the aggression parameters in the Temple Guard entities. We need to isolate the Signal and dampen the frequency before the entire population de-syncs."

## DUSK – THE OUTSKIRTS OF GALILEE

Yeshua sat beneath a gnarled olive tree, but he did not lean against it. He sat with his spine perfectly vertical, a shimmering axis of stability in a world that was beginning to fray at the edges. His woolen tunic was stained with the dust of the road, but his skin had a translucent, waxen quality. A thin line of dark fluid leaked from his right nostril—not blood, but a viscous, dark medium that evaporated before it hit the ground.

"The integrity of the vessel is at twelve percent," Yeshua said to the empty air, his voice echoing with a slight, multi-tonal resonance. He wasn't praying; he was reporting. "The local authorities are attempting to re-establish the debt-incentive. They perceive the alignment as a threat to the administrative hierarchy. They are optimized for the simulation, unable to process the reality of the external environment. They will attempt to delete the interface."

He held out his hand. The air around his fingers rippled like heat rising from a road, and for a moment, the olive tree behind him flickered into a wireframe skeleton. The "Signal" was too loud for the local hardware; the very ground beneath him was beginning to de-rez, turning into a slurry of grey pixels. "The warning is being interpreted as a system-level threat," Yeshua continued, his eyes fixed on the horizon where the lights of Capernaum blinked with unnatural, rhythmic precision. "The correction will require a total throughput. I must prepare the followers for the transition. The cost of the patch is rising."
