# Scene 1

## Outside Capernaum – Night

In the dream, the stars did not twinkle; they pulsed with the rhythmic, cold precision of a heartbeat. Joel lay on a bed of dry grass, but the ground beneath him felt less like earth and more like a suggestion of solidity. When he reached out to touch a nearby terebinth tree, his fingers didn't meet bark. Instead, the texture lagged. For a fraction of a second, the tree was a grey, unrendered pillar of geometric planes before the brown ridges of the trunk snapped into existence, shivering with a late-calculated detail.

Time began to leak. A goat nearby bleated, a sound that stretched into a low, metallic groan before snapping back to a sharp, high-pitched cry. Joel watched a stone roll down a small incline, but halfway through its descent, it vanished. It reappeared three inches higher than its last position, rolling down the exact same path again, tracing a line that felt pre-ordained and immutable. The world was peeling at the edges, revealing a blinding, structured void beneath the sky.

He tried to scream, but the air in his lungs felt viscous, like cooling wax. Every movement he made left a faint, translucent trail behind him—ghosts of his own limbs struggling to keep pace with the present. The horizon line flickered, a thin band of white light cutting through the hills of Galilee, suggesting that the mountains were not deep roots of stone, but thin veils pulled over something infinitely more complex.

## Outside Capernaum – Dawn

Joel woke with the taste of copper in his mouth and the smell of ozone clinging to his wool tunic. The morning sun was cresting the hills, casting long, amber shadows across the dusty road, but the light felt heavy, almost intrusive. He sat up, his heart hammering against his ribs, and looked at his hands. They were solid, lined with dirt and callouses, yet he couldn't shake the sensation that if he gripped them too tight, they might simply pass through one another.

He stood and walked toward the well, his movements deliberate and fearful. He watched a sparrow take flight from a low wall; it moved with a grace that should have been beautiful, but Joel found himself counting the beats of its wings, looking for the stutter he had seen in the dark. The world was too quiet, too resolved. The dust settling in the wake of a passing cart didn't drift; it seemed to find its place on the ground with a terrifying, mathematical certainty.

The unsettling feeling didn't fade with the rising sun. Instead, it curdled into a cold realization that the world was managed. He looked toward the village, where the first fires were being lit, and felt a sudden, inexplicable urge to flee. It wasn't that the world was a lie, but rather that it was a machine—one that had just suffered a momentary hiccup in its gears, and he was the only one who had heard the grind.

## The Company – Operations Floor

On the primary floor of the Originating Civilization, the air was sterile and hummed with the vibration of cooling fans. A wall of translucent monitors displayed the Galilee shard in a thousand different data points: heat maps, population density, and casualty probability. A technician in a charcoal-colored tunic tapped a glass interface, smoothing out a ripple in the local gravity constants that had briefly exceeded the safety threshold.

"The latency in the northern quadrant is stabilizing," the technician said, her voice devoid of emotion. "The dream-state bleed was unavoidable. We had to throttle the physics engine to prepare the environment for the insertion. The local observers will categorize it as a vision or a malaise. It’s a standard psychological buffer."

In the center of the room, a glass cylinder hummed with a concentrated blue light. Inside, a high-fidelity instance was being compiled—a human form, unremarkable in height and build, but woven from a denser, more stable code than the inhabitants of the simulation below. This was the Corrective Signal, a constrained version of their lead systems engineer, stripped of his elevated permissions but carrying the hard-coded intent of the creators. The deployment was green-lit; the patch was ready to be pushed to the live environment stepping into Capernaum.
