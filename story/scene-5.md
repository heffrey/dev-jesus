# Scene 5

## The Company Operations Floor – 0.004% Outside Real-Time

The operations floor was a cathedral of silent glass and the low, pressurized hum of liquid-cooled processors. Aris watched the telemetry from the Galilee sector, where a massive spike of localized stabilization was beginning to cool, leaving a jagged scar in the regional causality. On the primary hololith, the Jesus-instance was a pulsing amber dot, his integrity metrics flickering dangerously low. The healing of the boy had not been a simple deletion of disease; it had been a forced overwrite of the local physics, and the system was still vibrating from the impact.

"He’s overdrawing his allocated cycles," a technician remarked, her voice flat and clinical. She gestured to a cascading waterfall of blue data points. "The entropy hasn't been reduced, Aris. It’s just been redistributed. By mending the boy’s cellular structure, he’s accelerated the heat death of the surrounding three kilometers by a measurable fraction. He’s not fixing the leak; he’s just moving the water to a different bucket."

Aris rubbed his temples, the artificial light of the floor reflecting in his tired eyes. The debate had been raging since the insertion: whether this corrective signal was a genuine patch or a desperate, terminal diagnostic. "The goal isn't thermodynamic equilibrium," Aris countered, his gaze fixed on the amber dot. "The goal is to see if the inhabitants can recognize the correction. If they see the hand of the Engineer in the work, they might begin to decouple from the simulation’s dead-end logic."

The technician shook her head, her fingers dancing across a haptic interface to stabilize the sector’s refresh rate. "They aren't looking at the math, Aris. They’re looking at the man. They’re turning a system update into a mythology. You know as well as I do that warnings only work if they are understood, not worshipped. If they treat the signal as a god instead of a guide, the signal becomes just another layer of noise in a failing system."

## The Shore of Galilee – Dusk

The air at the edge of the water felt thin, as if the resolution of the world had dropped following the afternoon's events. Jesus sat on a sun-bleached limestone shelf, his feet trailing in the surf. To Joel, standing a few paces back, the man looked less like a miracle-worker and more like a laborer at the end of a double shift. There was a subtle, high-frequency vibration in Jesus’s hands that didn't match the rhythm of the wind, and his silhouette seemed to blur at the edges, a visual stutter that made Joel’s eyes ache.

"You look like you're coming apart," Joel said softly, stepping forward to offer a skin of water. He noticed that where Jesus’s shadow fell upon the sand, the grains didn't move with the breeze; they stayed unnaturally still, locked in a localized stasis. The miracle hadn't just healed his brother; it had bruised the very fabric of the evening.

Jesus took the water, his movements heavy and deliberate. "The skin is a narrow conduit, Joel. To move the light through it requires a certain... thinning of the vessel." He looked out across the dark expanse of the sea, his eyes reflecting a sky that Joel couldn't see, a sky composed of cold, geometric constants. "Your brother is a temporary fix in a permanent storm. I didn't come to change the weather; I came to show you how the wind is made."

Joel knelt in the cooling sand, watching a small crab scuttle toward the water. As it passed through the shadow of Jesus, it froze for a heartbeat, its movements becoming a series of jerky, frame-by-frame increments before it regained its fluidity on the other side. The dreams Joel had been having—the grids of light, the humming darkness—felt more real in this moment than the salt spray on his face. "If you break yourself to fix us," Joel asked, "what happens to the world when the repairman is gone?"
