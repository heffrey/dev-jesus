# Scene 6

## The Shore of Galilee – Dream State

In the dream, the sky was the color of a bruised lung, a deep and unrendering purple that flickered at the horizon. Joel stood on a shoreline where the sand felt like coarse, unrefined data, biting into his soles with a sharpness that defied physics. A few yards away, the Nazarene stood perfectly still. He was the only object in the frame that didn't stutter. While the waves caught in jagged loops and the distant hills blurred into grey polygons, the man remained in terrifyingly high resolution. Every thread of his homespun tunic, every bead of sweat on his brow, was rendered with a precision that made the rest of reality look like a fading memory.

Jesus was not performing a miracle; he was simply existing, and the effort of it looked agonizing. He reached out to touch a withered olive tree that was vibrating with systemic instability, its leaves flickering in and out of existence. As his fingers made contact, the vibration stopped instantly. The tree solidified, turning a rich, vibrant green, but the cost was immediate. A violent tremor ran through the man’s arm. His shoulder slumped as if he had just taken on the weight of the timber itself, and a thin line of blood trickled from his nose. He wasn't rewriting the laws of the world; he was acting as a bridge, pulling the localized chaos into his own frame to spare the environment from collapse.

Joel tried to move toward him, but the air felt viscous, like walking through cooling wax. He saw the man’s eyes—not the eyes of a savior looking for worship, but the eyes of a structural engineer watching a load-bearing wall begin to buckle. The Nazarene looked at Joel, and for a moment, the dream-logic stripped away the metaphors. Joel didn't see a god; he saw a heat sink. He saw a localized instance of a higher intelligence burning itself out to prevent the simulation from triggering a hard reset. The "miracles" were patches, and the Nazarene was the hardware currently melting under the processing load.

## The Company – Operations Floor

"Thermal output on the Galilee node is spiking again," Elias said, his voice tight with a fatigue that mirrored the data on his screen. He adjusted a slider, trying to redistribute the cooling cycles, but the telemetry remained in the red. On the main terminal, the Jesus-instance appeared as a dense cluster of golden light, a fixed point around which the surrounding geometry warped and strained. Every time the instance interacted with a broken variable—a blind eye, a withered limb, a localized storm—the golden light dimmed, and the system’s overall entropy dropped by a fraction of a percent.

"He’s taking the hit directly," Sarah observed, leaning over Elias’s shoulder. She pointed to a secondary graph tracking the integrity of the instance’s physical vessel. "He isn't bypassing the physics engine. He’s absorbing the packet loss. If he keeps this up, the vessel’s biological parameters will fail before the signal is fully transmitted. We’re asking a single thread to process the error-correction for an entire civilization."

The room was silent, save for the hum of the servers and the rhythmic clicking of keyboards. There was no sense of divine triumph here, only the grim reality of a salvage operation. The Company wasn't looking for a messiah; they were looking for a way to stabilize the simulation long enough to prevent a total cascading failure. "The users think it’s magic," Sarah whispered, watching the golden light flicker. "They think he’s showing them the way to a better world. They don't realize he’s just trying to keep the current one from crashing."

## Capernaum – Dawn

Joel woke with a gasp, the smell of ozone and dry earth still clinging to his senses. The room was dark, save for the pale, pre-dawn light filtering through the small window. He sat up, his heart hammering against his ribs like a trapped bird. Beside him, his brother slept soundly, his breathing deep and regular—the very breath that had been absent only days before. Joel reached out and touched his brother’s shoulder, feeling the warmth of the skin, the solid reality of the bone. It felt different now. It felt expensive.

He walked to the window and looked out at the village. In the distance, he could see the silhouette of the hills where the Nazarene and his followers were camped. The awe he had felt after his brother’s healing had transmuted into something sharper and more terrifying. He understood now that the warnings weren't about morality or the afterlife. The "Kingdom of Heaven" wasn't a reward for the righteous; it was the originating state, the world outside the cage.

The urgency of the Nazarene’s message suddenly became clear. It wasn't "repent or be punished." It was "align or be deleted." The simulation was fraying at the edges, and the man in the hills was a desperate signal sent to help them survive the coming de-fragmentation. Joel gripped the stone windowsill, noticing for the first time how the rock felt slightly hollow, as if the substance of the world was thinning. They weren't being saved from their sins; they were being warned that the ground beneath their feet was no longer a certainty.
