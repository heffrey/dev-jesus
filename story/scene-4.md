# Scene 4

## Capernaum – Three Miles Inland

The air inside the small stone dwelling was thick with the scent of bitter herbs and the metallic tang of a fever that had reached its breaking point. Joel’s brother, Elam, lay on a mat of woven reeds, his skin a translucent grey that seemed to vibrate with a frantic, low-frequency tremor. The others in the room stood back, their faces masked by the flickering shadows of a single oil lamp, but Joel watched the man they called Yeshua. The engineer did not move with the practiced grace of a healer; he moved with the cautious, deliberate precision of a man defusing a volatile explosive.

Yeshua knelt by the mat, his hands hovering inches above Elam’s chest. He did not pray. Instead, he stared at the space where the air met the skin, his eyes tracking something invisible to the rest. For a long second, he hesitated, his fingers twitching in a rhythmic sequence that looked like a man trying to find a grip on a glass wall. The air around Elam began to shimmer, not with light, but with a strange, oily distortion that made the corners of the room seem to bend inward. The sound in the room—the weeping of their mother, the crackle of the lamp—dropped an octave, becoming a muffled, underwater drone.

When Yeshua finally made contact, placing his palm flat against Elam’s sternum, the reaction was violent. A spark of static white light jumped between skin and hand, smelling sharply of ozone and scorched earth. Yeshua’s jaw clamped shut, his neck muscles cording as if he were bracing against a physical weight. The distortion intensified, a localized ripple in the geometry of the room that made Joel’s vision blur. Elam’s body arched, a single, sharp gasp tearing from his lungs, and then the fever broke—not fading, but simply ceasing to exist, as if a switch had been flipped.

## The Company – Monitoring Tier 4

"Thermal spikes in Sector 7-G," a technician announced, her fingers flying across a holographic interface that pulsed with amber warnings. "The Instance just forced a localized state-reversion. He didn't use the standard protocols; he bypassed the biological decay subroutines entirely." On the primary display, the Galilee simulation map flickered, the green wireframe turning a bruised purple around the coordinates of the Capernaum dwelling. The ambient hum of the server farm intensified, a low-end vibration that rattled the coffee cups on the workstations.

The Lead Architect stood behind the monitoring station, his eyes fixed on the telemetry. "He’s drawing too much from the local buffer," he muttered, his voice tight with professional concern. "If he keeps hot-patching the physics like that, the latency is going to become visible to the native assets. We're already seeing a three-millisecond drift in the surrounding light-render." He tapped a command, attempting to throttle the power flow to the Yeshua instance, but the system returned a 'Permissions Denied' error. 

A red icon began to pulse on the main screen: *System Strain: 14% Above Nominal.* The miracle hadn't been a free gift; it had been a resource-heavy intervention that pushed the local environment toward a hardware limit. "He’s hurting the frame rate to save one line of code," the technician said, her voice dropping to a whisper. "The Creator told him to signal, not to rewrite the architecture on the fly."

## Capernaum – Outside the Courtyard

Yeshua stumbled out of the house moments later, his face ashen and slick with a cold, unnatural sweat. He leaned heavily against the rough limestone wall, his breath coming in ragged, shallow pulls. To Joel, following him into the cooling evening air, the man looked less like a savior and more like a laborer who had just spent a day hauling stones up a mountain. The vibrant intensity that usually burned in Yeshua’s eyes had dimmed to a dull, flickering amber. He looked fragile, as if his very presence in the world was becoming difficult to maintain.

Joel stood a few paces away, his mind racing. He looked at the horizon, where the sun was dipping toward the Great Sea, and for a fleeting second, the colors of the sunset didn't look like light. They looked like the tiered gradients of the grid he saw in his sleep—the vast, mathematical lattice that underpinned the world. He remembered his dream from the night before: a Great Architect weeping over a broken machine. Seeing Yeshua’s exhaustion, the way the man wiped a trace of dark, viscous fluid from his nose, Joel realized the "miracle" hadn't been an act of magic. It had been an act of repair.

"You're tired," Joel said softly, the words feeling inadequate. Yeshua turned to look at him, and for a moment, Joel saw a flicker of data-streams behind the man’s pupils—a cascading waterfall of golden light that didn't belong in a human eye. The air between them hummed with the remnants of the strain, a static charge that made Joel’s hair stand on end. Yeshua didn't answer with a parable; he simply nodded, a slow, heavy movement that suggested he was counting the cost of every second he remained upright. The signal had been delivered, but the medium was beginning to crack under the pressure of the message.
