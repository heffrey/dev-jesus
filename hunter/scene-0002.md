# Scene 2

## Sunset / Henderson’s Gas Station

The red 1985 Camaro rolled onto the cracked asphalt of the station with a low, rhythmic protest from its strained engine. Sarah kept her hands locked at ten and two, her knuckles white against the steering wheel, while Annie watched the "bruised purple" light of the Texas sunset bleed into the black silhouettes of the loblolly pines. The gas station was a squat, cinder block relic painted a jaundiced yellow that had long since surrendered to the elements. Outside, the two mechanical pumps stood like rusted sentinels, their analog dials frozen in a mid-click stutter that felt like a localized glitch in the flow of time.

Annie stepped out of the car, the heavy scent of ozone and old oil hitting her instantly. She adjusted her denim jacket, her fingers brushing against the folding knife in her pocket for a sense of tactile reality. The air here felt thicker, more viscous than it had on the open road. To her left, the Woods pressed against the edge of the parking lot, the Spanish moss hanging from the live oaks like tattered grey code. She could hear the buzzing of the fluorescent lights inside the station—a high-pitched, oscillating frequency that made the hair on her arms stand up. It wasn't just noise; it felt like a carrier wave, a background hum meant to mask something deeper.

Sarah stayed by the car, her eyes scanning the perimeter with predatory intensity, but Annie felt drawn toward the dim interior of the building. As she pushed the door open, a bell chimed—a flat, digital sound that ended too abruptly, lacking a natural decay. Inside, the shelves were skeletal, holding a few lonely cans of off-brand beans and bags of stale crackers. Behind the counter sat Henderson, a man who looked like he had been carved out of the very oak trees that surrounded the property. His eyes were milky but sharp, tracking Annie’s movement with a terrifyingly lucid focus.

## Twilight / The Station Interior

"You're late for the update," Henderson said, his voice a gravelly rasp that seemed to bypass Annie's ears and resonate directly in her chest. He didn't look up from the small, handheld radio he was tinkering with, its guts spilled across the counter in a mess of copper wire and green circuit boards. He spoke in the clipped, cryptic manner of a man who had spent decades reading the fine print of the world. "The signal is degrading. You can feel it, can’t you? The way the light doesn't quite hit the dust right anymore."

Annie reached for a lukewarm soda and a map from the rack, her hand trembling slightly. "We just need to get through the night," she replied, her voice sounding thin in the cramped space. Henderson finally looked up, his gaze lingering on her as if he were seeing the wireframe beneath her skin. He reached under the counter and produced a "new" map—this one hand-drawn on vellum that felt unnervingly like skin. He slid it toward her, his weathered finger pointing to a path that bypassed the main blacktop. "The hunter doesn't sleep, girl. He’s part of the architecture. You’re just a variable he’s been tasked to resolve."

The exchange was interrupted by the low, guttural thrum of a heavy engine entering the lot. Annie froze, her heart hammering against her ribs like a trapped bird. Through the yellowed advertisements for beer and cigarettes plastered on the windows, she saw a black pickup truck pull up to the opposite pump. It was a monolith of matte steel, devoid of chrome or identifying marks. The driver didn't get out. Through the tinted glass, she saw the silhouette of a man wearing a sweat-stained trucker hat. Even in the dim light, the cold, calculating stillness of his posture was unmistakable. It was Dale, or at least, a perfect iteration of him.

## Nightfall / The Parking Lot

Annie retreated toward the door, her pulse thundering. "Sarah, we have to go," she hissed as she stepped back onto the cracked asphalt. Sarah was already moving, her hand hovering near the heavy wrench she’d pulled from the Camaro’s footwell. The man in the black truck didn't move, but his presence felt like a weight, a gravitational pull that threatened to collapse the scene. Annie felt a wave of nausea—the "creeps" manifesting as a physical distortion. For a split second, the black truck seemed to flicker, its edges sharpening and then blurring as if the world were struggling to render its density.

The man in the truck turned his head. Even through the glass, Annie felt the impact of those dead, calculating eyes. There was no malice in them, only the grim determination of a program executing a command. He looked exactly like the man who had haunted her father’s stories, the relentless force that had been tracking their bloodline across every county line and every decade. The scar above his left eye was a jagged line of white light in the dark cabin, a reminder of a previous hunt where the prey had dared to bite back.

"Move," Sarah commanded, her voice a sharp anchor in the rising tide of Annie's panic. They scrambled into the Camaro, the engine turning over with a desperate, metallic scream before catching. As they peeled away from Henderson’s, the tires spitting gravel against the cinder block walls, Annie looked back in the side mirror. The black pickup truck remained stationary at the pump, its headlights suddenly snapping on—two twin beams of sterile, white light that sliced through the humid dark of the Piney Woods, marking the beginning of the next cycle. Henderson stood in the doorway, a dark silhouette against the buzzing yellow light, watching them go with the somber patience of a man who knew exactly how the script ended.
