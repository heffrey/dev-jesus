# Scene 1

## Afternoon - The Road

The red 1985 Camaro cut through the heat shimmer like a jagged wound across the Texas landscape. The asphalt of the County Road was a mosaic of neglect, heat-softened tar oozing from cracks that Sarah navigated with practiced, economical movements. Inside the cabin, the air was a thick soup of recycled oxygen and the faint, metallic tang of an engine pushed to its limits. Sarah kept her hands at ten and two, her knuckles white against the cracked steering wheel, her eyes constantly scanning the horizon where the blacktop bled into the sky.

Annie sat in the passenger seat, her boots resting on a floorboard littered with empty water bottles and crumpled maps. She watched the telephone poles flicker past, rhythmic and skeletal, their sagging wires tracing a path toward an uncertain destination. Every few miles, she would glance at the rearview mirror, checking the empty stretch of road behind them. There was a quiet confidence in the way she moved, a stillness learned from years of hiding, but her fingers toyed restlessly with the hem of her denim jacket.

The heat outside was oppressive, a physical weight that seemed to distort the very air. To Annie, the world felt fragile, like a film reel melting under a hot lamp. The pine trees lining the road didn't just sway; they seemed to jitter in the periphery of her vision, their needles a shade of green that felt almost too vibrant to be natural. She looked at her mother, seeing the hard line of Sarah’s jaw and the way her eyes never truly relaxed. Sarah was the anchor, the one who kept the car moving through a reality that felt increasingly like it was fraying at the edges.

## Late Afternoon - The Gas Station

Henderson's appeared like a yellowed tooth in a decaying mouth. The cinder block building was a faded, sickly ochre, its windows plastered with sun-bleached advertisements for brands that hadn't existed in years. Sarah slowed the Camaro, the gravel of the lot crunching beneath the tires with a sound like breaking bone. She didn't pull directly up to the pumps; instead, she circled the perimeter once, her gaze sharp and predatory, before killing the engine near the rusted-out shell of a payphone.

"Stay low," Sarah said, her voice low and gravelly. She didn't look at Annie, her focus already on the dim interior of the station. She reached into the footwell, checking the weight of a heavy wrench she kept there—a practical tool for a practical woman. Her movements were purposeful, stripped of any wasted energy. She had taught Annie that every second spent in the open was a second borrowed from a debt they couldn't afford to pay.

Annie nodded, her expression shifting into a strained, practiced smile that didn't reach her eyes. She climbed out of the car, the humid air hitting her like a damp shroud. The scent of the place was a cocktail of spilled gasoline, ancient grease, and the cloying sweetness of the surrounding pine woods. She stood by the passenger door, acting as the lookout, her eyes tracking the movement of a plastic bag caught in the weeds. The silence of the station was punctuated only by the rhythmic *click-clack* of the mechanical fuel numbers and the distant, mournful cry of a crow hidden in the Spanish moss.

## Inside Henderson's

The interior of the station was a tomb of forgotten commerce. Fluorescent lights overhead buzzed with a frantic, dying energy, flickering in a pattern that made the shadows dance across the half-empty shelves. Sarah moved through the aisles with the silence of a ghost, her boots making no sound on the linoleum. She gathered what she could—stale crackers, a few cans of lukewarm soda, a map that looked slightly less disintegrated than the one in the car. Everything was coated in a fine layer of gray dust that felt like ash between her fingers.

Annie followed a few paces behind, her quick-witted gaze darting toward the back of the store. She paused by a display of faded sunglasses, catching her own reflection in the grime-streaked mirror. For a moment, she looked younger, the resilience in her face giving way to a flicker of the girl she might have been in a different world. Then, a sharp pop from a cooling refrigerator made her jump, her hand instinctively reaching for the pocket where she kept her folding knife.

They met at the counter, where the air smelled of stale coffee and ozone. There was no attendant, only a heavy silence that felt watchful, as if the building itself were waiting for them to make a mistake. Sarah set a handful of crumpled bills on the counter—a habit of a world that still pretended to function—and gestured for Annie to head back to the car. As they stepped back out into the fading light, the sun was a bruised purple behind the loblolly pines, casting long, distorted shadows that stretched across the cracked asphalt toward the road they had yet to travel.
