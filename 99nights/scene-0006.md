# Scene 6

## Night 16: The Mirror-Galleries of the Gloaming Throat

The Iron Breath had subsided, replaced by a silence so viscous it felt like wading through cooling wax. XPM moved with a mechanical precision, his leather hand wraps rasping against the iron-bound cradle of the Solemn Ember. The amber light within pulsed with a rhythmic, sickly cadence, casting long, distorted shadows that seemed to peel away from the iron-bark trees and linger a second too long. Beside him, Jack was little more than a frantic cerulean smudge, his spirit-form flickering like a dying candle in a gale. The boy’s teeth—or the psychic equivalent of them—chattered, a frantic vibration that XPM felt in the marrow of his own aching bones.

The Obsidian Weald had ceased its frantic shifting, settling into a terrifyingly static geometry. Here, the trees did not pulse; they watched. Hanging from the low-slung branches were the Hollow-Walkers, spindly, long-limbed husks of travelers who had lost their rhythm to the Great Stillness. Their faces were not flesh, but shards of polished obsidian—perfect, dark mirrors that caught the dim amber glow and fractured it into a thousand false leads. They did not attack; they simply drifted through the violet twilight, their movements mimicking XPM’s heavy stride with mocking accuracy.

"Elara, wait," Jack whispered, his voice a thin reed in the oppressive quiet. He stopped, his cerulean form hovering near a cluster of Silver-Thistle that vibrated with a low, seductive hum. One of the Hollow-Walkers drifted closer, its mirror-face tilting. In the reflection, Jack didn’t see the dark forest or his own ghostly pallor; he saw a sun-drenched meadow from a memory he shouldn't have possessed—a place of warmth and golden grass. "I can hear it. Not the forest... a hearth. A real hearth, Elara. Just through the thicket."

## Night 16: The Snare of Reflected Memory

XPM didn't stop. He knew the weight of the vellum map in his pocket, the way the ley-lines of the Sanctuary of Soot were supposed to feel—jagged and hot, not soft like the hum Jack was following. "Stay close, Tinder-Lad," XPM rumbled, his voice like grinding stones. "The Weald feeds on what you want to see. Look at the ground, not the glass." But the exhaustion was a physical weight, a coat of lead mail draped over his shoulders. His joints, stiffened by the salt and the silver-thistle residue, protested every movement, slowing his reaction as Jack drifted toward the shimmering obsidian face of a Walker.

The trap snapped shut with the sound of a closing tomb. As Jack reached out toward the mirror, the Hollow-Walker’s limbs elongated, turning into barbed briars that lashed out to entwine his spirit-form. The cerulean light of the boy flared bright with terror, then began to dim as the mirror-face started to drink his essence, the reflected meadow turning into a frozen wasteland of gray ash. The forest floor heaved, the iron-bark roots twisting upward to form a cage around the boy, sealing him within a pocket of absolute cold—a micro-domain of the Great Stillness.

From the periphery of the darkness, two glowing red orbs ignited. The Architect of Stasis was watching, its bipedal, stag-like silhouette looming between the trees, waiting for the Solemn Ember to falter. XPM felt the temperature drop sharply, the Iron Breath returning as a localized frost that threatened to freeze his lungs. He reached for the iron cradle, his fingers fumbling with the brass hilt of the Amber filter, a relic designed for the moments when the forest stopped being a labyrinth and started being a predator.

## Night 16: The Flare of the Amber Filter

With a sharp, metallic click, XPM slid the Amber filter over the lantern’s aperture. The soft, pulsing glow of the Solemn Ember was instantly transformed into a harsh, concentrated beam of incandescent orange light. It wasn't merely illumination; it was a physical force, a projection of the First Dawn’s fury. Where the amber light touched the Hollow-Walkers, their mirror-faces did not reflect—they shattered. The obsidian shards turned to black sand, and the creatures let out a subsonic wail that shook the Oyl-Berries from the nearby shrubs, filling the air with a pungent, chemical stench.

XPM stepped into the fray, his staff striking the frozen earth in time with his heavy heart. He swept the beam across the briar-cage, the heat of the filtered Ember melting the iron-bark like wax. Jack tumbled out, his form gray and tattered, clinging to XPM’s salt-crusted wraps for stability. The Great Stillness let out a low, guttural huff—a sound of frustrated hunger—and retreated back into the deeper shadows of the Gloaming Throat, its red eyes the last thing to vanish into the violet dark.

"Keep your eyes on the cradle," XPM commanded, his voice strained by the effort of channeling the Ember’s raw power. The filter was cooling, the brass turning a dull, scorched brown. He could feel the forest rearranging itself again, the geometry fracturing in its haste to find a new way to impede them. They were close now; the smell of soot and old volcanic ash was beginning to cut through the metallic tang of the Weald. The Sanctuary of Soot lay ahead, but the walk through the mirror-galleries had cost them precious time, and the light in the cradle was burning thinner than it ever had before.
