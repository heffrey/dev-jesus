- Key Items (XPM): Iron-bound cradle containing the "Solemn Ember" (a pulsing amber star-fragment that draws moisture/life-force from the bearer), flint, catalytic marrow, and a staff.
- Key Items (Jack): Translucent spirit-tether and navigational charms.
- Character States: XPM is stoic and physically burdened; Jack is a flickering spirit-form who turns pale blue when terrified and can "hear" the forest.
- Plot Development: The path behind them has vanished into thorns and fractured space; Whisper-Moss has recorded their presence in its "ledger."
- Antagonist: "The Great Stillness" (Architect of Stasis) has sensed the Ember's ignition and begun hunting the duo.
