### The Setting: The Obsidian Weald
The forest is not a static geography but a living, breathing labyrinth of iron-barked trees and bioluminescent flora that pulses in time with the protagonist’s heartbeat. Known as the Obsidian Weald, it is a place where the sun died centuries ago, leaving behind a permanent, violet twilight. The ground is a carpet of "Whisper-Moss" that records the footsteps of everything that passes, playing back the sounds of previous nights to confuse the traveler.

### The Protagonist: The Wick-Keeper
You play as Elara, a Wick-Keeper tasked with carrying the "Solemn Ember," the last fragment of a fallen star, through the forest to the Altar of the First Dawn. The Ember is housed in a cracked glass lantern; it provides the only warmth in the freezing woods and serves as your primary resource. If the flame dies, the forest claims your physical form, turning you into one of the "Stiffened"—the frozen, wooden statues that litter the trails.

### The Cycle: The 99 Nights
The journey is divided into three distinct lunar phases, each escalating in environmental and psychological intensity.

**Phase I: The Nursery of Briars (Nights 1–33)**
The forest is curious but not yet predatory. The primary challenges are navigation and resource management. You must gather "Oyl-Berries" to fuel the lantern and "Silver-Thistle" to ward off the minor sprites that attempt to blow out your light. The nights are long, but the shadows are soft. You discover the ruins of previous Wick-Keepers, finding tattered journals that offer cryptic maps.

**Phase II: The Gloaming Throat (Nights 34–66)**
The canopy thickens until the sky is invisible. The trees begin to move, closing paths behind you. A thick, metallic fog—the "Iron Breath"—settles in, chilling the Ember and muffling sound. During these nights, the "Hollow-Walkers" appear: tall, spindly entities with mirrors for faces that mimic Elara’s movements. Survival requires "Silent-Stepping" and using the lantern’s shutter to blink signals to friendly, hidden spirits.

**Phase III: The Heart of the Root (Nights 67–98)**
Reality begins to fracture. The forest no longer obeys Euclidean geometry; walking forward might lead you backward, and trees may grow from the ceiling of the world. The Ember begins to consume Elara’s memories for fuel. To keep the light alive, you must sacrifice "Memory Shards"—vivid flashbacks of your life before the forest. By Night 90, the protagonist is a shell of their former self, driven only by the primal instinct to reach the Altar.

### The Antagonist: The Great Stillness
The forest is overseen by an ancient entity known as The Great Stillness, a colossal, multi-eyed stag whose antlers are made of the bleached bones of failed travelers. It does not attack directly; instead, it watches from the periphery, its presence causing the air to crystallize. It represents the forest’s desire for eternal stasis. Every eleven nights, the Stillness enters the camp, requiring a "Toll of Breath"—a rhythmic minigame where the player must control Elara’s breathing to remain undetected.

### The Mechanics of Survival
*   **The Hearth-Stone:** Each night, you must find a Hearth-Stone to anchor your camp. These stones act as save points but require a "Blood-Offering" or a "Secret-Told" to activate.
*   **The Bestiary of Echoes:** Enemies are not killed but "soothed." By using different colored light filters on the lantern (Indigo for aggression, Amber for fear), you can pacify the creatures of the Weald.
*   **The Weight of Light:** The brighter the lantern burns, the safer you are from the cold, but the more "Predatory Shadows" are attracted to your location. You must balance visibility with stealth.

### Night 99: The Convergence
On the final night, the forest becomes a vertical climb. The trees intertwine to form a massive, spiral staircase leading toward the canopy. The Great Stillness makes its final stand, attempting to blow out the Solemn Ember with a blizzard of "Ash-Snow." The player must use every Memory Shard they have saved—or sacrificed—to shield the flame.

### The Ending: The 100th Dawn
The game concludes not with a battle, but with the arrival of the 100th morning. If the Ember reaches the Altar, it ignites the sky, burning away the Obsidian Weald and revealing that the forest was a cocoon for a world waiting to be reborn. Elara’s fate depends on how many memories were sacrificed; she either becomes the new sun or a silent guardian of the new world.
