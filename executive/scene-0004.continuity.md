- Elias’s Possessions: Cheap/heavy boots and a standard wool overcoat.
- Claire’s State: Dressed in a charcoal-colored knit; cold, professional, and emotionally detached; views her father as a "variable factored out."
- Plot Developments: Elias has liquidated Thorne Industries; the "Monolith" is empty; Julian possesses the company logs.
