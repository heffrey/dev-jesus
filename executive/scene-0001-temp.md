# Scene 1

## 09:00 AM — The 88th Floor

Marcus, the head of Elias's private security detail, stood at the entrance of the primary suite, his presence a localized disturbance in the room's curated silence. He was a man built for the physical defense of a fortress, a human wall meant to filter out the inconveniences of the living. Elias looked at him and saw the "Gilded Reach" personified—the architectural arrogance of a man who believed he could buy safety through isolation. Marcus held a tablet, his brow furrowed at the sudden cessation of payroll protocols for the entire security firm.

"The contracts have been terminated, Marcus," Elias said, his voice carrying the flat, uninflected tone of a system notification. "The severance packages are already in your accounts. You and your men are to vacate the building by noon. I am decommissioning the perimeter."

Marcus hesitated, his training momentarily failing him in the face of such a quiet surrender. "Sir, the threats against you haven't changed. Without the detail, Thorne Tower is a target. You're inviting the world in." Elias merely nodded, a slight, almost imperceptible movement. He wasn't just firing a bodyguard; he was deleting the firewall. He wanted the world to reach him; he wanted the friction of reality to finally grate against his skin.
