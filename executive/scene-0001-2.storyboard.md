## Panel 1: Establishing Shot — Marcus's Entrance

**Time Banner:** "09:00 AM — THE 88TH FLOOR" (top-left)

**Visual Composition:**
- **Setting:** Expansive, minimalist office suite with dark, polished obsidian floors that reflect light and figures. Large, floor-to-ceiling windows dominate the background, offering a panoramic view of a city skyline under a twilight or overcast sky with purple-grey clouds. Tall, silhouetted buildings dominate the background.
- **Lighting:** Recessed architectural lighting casting long, dramatic shadows. The violet-purple glow of Manhattan twilight (#4B0082) filters through the windows.
- **Atmosphere:** Curated silence, sterile and controlled.

**Characters:**
- **Marcus:** Stands near an open doorway on the left, facing towards the center of the room. Muscular build, serious expression. Wears a dark suit (#0A0A0F), white shirt, and tie. Holds a dark tablet in both hands, looking down at it or contemplating its contents. Posture is rigid, suggesting attentiveness or duty.
- **Elias:** Stands further into the room, to the right of the windows, with his back mostly to the viewer. Wears a dark suit (#0A0A0F). Only his profile is visible—short, neat silver-grey hair (#A9A9A9), glasses. His pose is calm and composed, looking out at the city view.

**Narration Caption (below panel):**
> "MARCUS, THE HEAD OF ELIAS'S PRIVATE SECURITY DETAIL, STOOD AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE PRIMARY SUITE, HIS PRESENCE A LOCALIZED DISTURBANCE IN THE ROOM'S CURATED SILENCE."

**Visual Style Notes:**
- High contrast between the dark interior and the city lights outside
- Reflections on the polished floor add depth
- Minimalist composition emphasizing the vast, empty space
- Color palette: Obsidian (#050505), Titanium (#A0A0A0), Bruised Purple (#4B0082)

## Panel 2: Close-Up — Elias Delivers the Termination

**Visual Composition:**
- **Focus:** Close-up shot focusing on Elias as he delivers the significant statement
- **Camera Angle:** Medium close-up, slightly low angle to emphasize authority
- **Background:** Marcus is visible behind Elias, partially obscured, showing shock

**Characters:**
- **Elias (foreground):** Now facing the viewer. Close-up reveals stern, unyielding expression. Wears glasses, dark suit (#0A0A0F), white shirt, and tie. Mouth slightly open, indicating speech. Ice-blue eyes (#4682B4) showing clinical detachment. Pale, sallow complexion (#D1C4B2) with signs of fatigue.
- **Marcus (background):** Face partially obscured behind Elias, but expression clearly shows shock or dismay—wide eyes, slightly open mouth, brow furrowed.

**Dialogue Bubble (from Elias):**
> "THE CONTRACTS HAVE BEEN TERMINATED, MARCUS. THE SEVERANCE PACKAGES ARE ALREADY IN YOUR ACCOUNTS. YOU AND YOUR MEN ARE TO VACATE THE BUILDING BY NOON. I AM DECOMMISSIONING THE PERIMETER."

**Narration Caption (below panel):**
> ""THE CONTRACTS HAVE BEEN TERMINATED, MARCUS," ELIAS SAID, HIS VOICE CARRYING THE FLAT, UNINFLECTED TONE OF A SYSTEM NOTIFICATION."

**Visual Style Notes:**
- Dramatic chiaroscuro lighting on Elias's face
- Sharp, clinical lines emphasizing the cold delivery
- The dialogue bubble should be bold, capitalized, conveying authority
- Background slightly out of focus to draw attention to Elias

## Panel 3: Close-Up — Marcus's Reaction

**Visual Composition:**
- **Focus:** Close-up of Marcus, capturing his immediate emotional reaction
- **Camera Angle:** Medium close-up, eye level
- **Background:** Slightly blurred, keeping focus on Marcus's expression

**Characters:**
- **Marcus:** Face fully visible, showing clear distress and disbelief. Brow furrowed deeply, eyes wide and slightly downcast, mouth open in a gasp or attempt to speak. Hands slightly raised—one still holding the tablet, the other open—conveying being overwhelmed or about to protest. His professional composure is breaking.

**Dialogue Bubble (small, hesitant, from Marcus):**
> "BUT SIR..."

**Narration Caption (below panel):**
> "MARCUS HESITATED, HIS TRAINING MOMENTARILY FAILING HIM IN THE FACE OF SUCH A QUIET SURRENDER."

**Visual Style Notes:**
- Emotional contrast with previous panel's clinical detachment
- Softer lines to show vulnerability
- The small dialogue bubble emphasizes his hesitation
- Expression should show the weight of the moment—professional duty conflicting with personal shock
